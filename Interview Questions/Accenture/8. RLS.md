## **8. Row-Level Security (RLS)**  

**RLS** restricts data access at the row level based on user roles.  

**How It Works**:  
1. **Define Roles**: Create roles in Power BI Desktop (e.g., "North America Sales").  
2. **Apply DAX Filters**: Write DAX expressions to filter data for each role.  
3. **Map Users**: In the Power BI Service, map users/groups to roles.  

**Types**:  
- **Static RLS**: Separate roles for each filter entity.  
- **Dynamic RLS**: Use `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` to look up filters from a security table.  

> [!TIP]  
> Dynamic RLS is more scalable for large organizations.
