## **11. Optimizing DAX Calculation: `Total = a * b / c * d`**  

This question tests your ability to write robust, efficient, and readable DAX code.  

**Original Formula**:  
`Total = a * b / c * d`  

**Issues**:  
- **Ambiguity**: Due to left-to-right operator precedence, this calculates as `((a * b) / c) * d`.  
- **Division by Zero**: If `c` is zero or blank, it will throw an error.  

**Optimized Solution**:  
Use the `DIVIDE()` function and variables for clarity and efficiency.  

```dax  
Total Optimized =  
VAR Numerator = [a] * [b]   
VAR Denominator = [c] * [d]
VAR Result = DIVIDE(Numerator, Denominator, 0)  // Returns 0 if division by zero occurs  
RETURN Result  
```  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Why This Is Better**:  
1. **Error Handling**: `DIVIDE()` automatically handles division by zero.  
2. **Readability**: Variables break the calculation into logical steps.  
3. **Performance**: Variables are calculated once, reducing redundant computations.
