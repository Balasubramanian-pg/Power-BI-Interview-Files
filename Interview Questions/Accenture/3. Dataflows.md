## **3. What Are Dataflows in Power BI?**  

**Dataflows** are a **cloud-based, self-service data preparation** feature in Power BI.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Reusable ETL**: Create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) logic using Power Query in the Power BI Service.  
- **Centralized Data**: Outputs stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as tables (entities).  
- **Single Source of Truth**: Multiple datasets can connect to the same dataflow, ensuring consistent data.  
- **Separation of Duties**: Data preparation (dataflows) is separate from data modeling and reporting (Power BI Desktop).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Dataflows are ideal for creating a "Golden Dataset" used across multiple reports.
