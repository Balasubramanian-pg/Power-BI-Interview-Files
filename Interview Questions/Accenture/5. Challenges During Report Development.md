## **5. Challenges During Report Development**  

Common challenges and solutions:  

1. **Poor Data Quality**:  
   - **Challenge**: Messy source data with nulls, incorrect types, and inconsistencies.  
   - **Solution**: Use **Power Query** for cleansing: profile data, replace values, change types, and unpivot as needed.  

2. **Slow Report Performance**:  
   - **Challenge**: Slow visuals or slicers.  
   - **Solution**: Use **Performance Analyzer** to identify bottlenecks. Optimize the model (star schema), rewrite DAX, or reduce data cardinality.  

3. **Vague/Changing Requirements**:  
   - **Challenge**: Unclear or shifting business needs.  
   - **Solution**: Use an **agile approach** with prototypes and frequent stakeholder check-ins.  

4. **Complex DAX Calculations**:  
   - **Challenge**: Semi-additive measures or complex time intelligence.  
   - **Solution**: Break down logic into variables, test incrementally, and use **DAX Studio** for performance analysis.  

> [!TIP]  
> Always start with a prototype to align expectations early.
