## **1. Optimizing DAX Calculation: `Total = a * b / c * d`**  

This question tests your ability to write robust, efficient, and readable DAX code.  

**Original Formula**:  
`Total = a * b / c * d`  

**Issues**:  
- **Ambiguity**: Due to left-to-right operator precedence, this calculates as `((a * b) / c) * d`.  
- **Division by Zero**: If `c` is zero or blank, it will throw an error.  

**Optimized Solution**:  
Use the `DIVIDE()` function and variables for clarity and efficiency.  

```dax  
Total Optimized =  
VAR Numerator = [a] * [b]   
VAR Denominator = [c] * [d]
VAR Result = DIVIDE(Numerator, Denominator, 0)  // Returns 0 if division by zero occurs  
RETURN Result  
```  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Why This Is Better**:  
1. **Error Handling**: `DIVIDE()` automatically handles division by zero.  
2. **Readability**: Variables break the calculation into logical steps.  
3. **Performance**: Variables are calculated once, reducing redundant computations.  

## **2. Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema**  

These are two common data modeling designs used in data warehousing and BI.  

| **Feature**          | **Star Schema**                                                                 | **Snowflake Schema**                                                          |  
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Structure**         | Central **Fact table** connected directly to **Dimension tables**. Looks like a star. | Central **Fact table** connected to normalized **Dimension tables**. Looks like a snowflake. |  
| **Normalization**     | Dimensions are **denormalized** (redundant data).                               | Dimensions are **normalized** (no redundancy).                                |  
| **Query Complexity**  | Simpler and faster queries (fewer joins).                                       | More complex queries (multiple joins required).                               |  
| **Performance in Power BI** | **Highly recommended**. Optimized for Power BIâ€™s VertiPaq engine. | **Not recommended**. Extra joins slow down performance.                       |  
| **Data Redundancy**   | Higher redundancy, slightly larger storage footprint.                          | Lower redundancy, easier maintenance.                                         |  

> [!TIP]  
> **For Power BI**, always transform a snowflake schema into a star schema in Power Query for better performance.  

## **3. What Are Dataflows in Power BI?**  

**Dataflows** are a **cloud-based, self-service data preparation** feature in Power BI.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- **Reusable ETL**: Create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) logic using Power Query in the Power BI Service.  
- **Centralized Data**: Outputs stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as tables (entities).  
- **Single Source of Truth**: Multiple datasets can connect to the same dataflow, ensuring consistent data.  
- **Separation of Duties**: Data preparation (dataflows) is separate from data modeling and reporting (Power BI Desktop).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Dataflows are ideal for creating a "Golden Dataset" used across multiple reports.  

## **4. Different Refresh Types in Power BI**  

The refresh type depends on the **Data Connection Mode** (Import, DirectQuery, Live Connection).  

**For Import Mode**:  
1. **Manual Refresh**: On-demand refresh via the Power BI Service.  
2. **Scheduled Refresh**:  
   - **Power BI Pro**: Up to 8 times/day.  
   - **Power BI Premium**: Up to 48 times/day.  
3. **Incremental Refresh** (Premium Feature): Refreshes only recent data partitions for large datasets.  

**For DirectQuery / Live Connection Mode**:  
- No data refresh; queries are sent to the source in real-time.  
- **Automatic Page Refresh**: Configurable interval to refresh visuals (e.g., every 5 minutes).  

> [!WARNING]  
> DirectQuery/Live Connection modes bypass the data model, so performance depends on the source system.  

## **5. Challenges During Report Development**  

Common challenges and solutions:  

1. **Poor Data Quality**:  
   - **Challenge**: Messy source data with nulls, incorrect types, and inconsistencies.  
   - **Solution**: Use **Power Query** for cleansing: profile data, replace values, change types, and unpivot as needed.  

2. **Slow Report Performance**:  
   - **Challenge**: Slow visuals or slicers.  
   - **Solution**: Use **Performance Analyzer** to identify bottlenecks. Optimize the model (star schema), rewrite DAX, or reduce data cardinality.  

3. **Vague/Changing Requirements**:  
   - **Challenge**: Unclear or shifting business needs.  
   - **Solution**: Use an **agile approach** with prototypes and frequent stakeholder check-ins.  

4. **Complex DAX Calculations**:  
   - **Challenge**: Semi-additive measures or complex time intelligence.  
   - **Solution**: Break down logic into variables, test incrementally, and use **DAX Studio** for performance analysis.  

> [!TIP]  
> Always start with a prototype to align expectations early.  

## **6. Field Parameters**  

**Field Parameters** allow users to dynamically change measures or dimensions in a visual.  

**Example Use Cases**:  
- **Dynamic Measures**: Switch between `[Total Sales]`, `[Total Profit]`, etc., using a slicer.  
- **Dynamic Dimensions**: Change the X-axis to analyze by `Product Category`, `Region`, etc.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Enhances interactivity and reduces the need for multiple visuals.  


## **7. Keeping Default Total Sales Values with Filters**  

To keep default totals even when users apply filters, modify the filter context using `CALCULATE` and filter-removing functions.  

**Scenario 1: Ignore ALL Filters**  
```dax  
Total Sales (All Filters Removed) =  
CALCULATE([Total Sales], REMOVEFILTERS())  
```  

**Scenario 2: Ignore Filters from a Specific Table**  
```dax  
Total Sales (Ignoring Product Filter) =  
CALCULATE([Total Sales], REMOVEFILTERS('Product'))  
```  

**Scenario 3: Ignore All Filters EXCEPT One**  
```dax  
Total Sales (Ignoring All But Date) =  
CALCULATE([Total Sales], ALLEXCEPT('FactSales', 'Date'[Date]))  
```  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Use `REMOVEFILTERS()` or `ALL()` to reset filter contexts selectively.  

## **8. Row-Level Security (RLS)**  

**RLS** restricts data access at the row level based on user roles.  

**How It Works**:  
1. **Define Roles**: Create roles in Power BI Desktop (e.g., "North America Sales").  
2. **Apply DAX Filters**: Write DAX expressions to filter data for each role.  
3. **Map Users**: In the Power BI Service, map users/groups to roles.  

**Types**:  
- **Static RLS**: Separate roles for each filter entity.  
- **Dynamic RLS**: Use `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` to look up filters from a security table.  

> [!TIP]  
> Dynamic RLS is more scalable for large organizations.  

## **9. Custom Sorting of Categories**  

To sort a category column (e.g., `c, d, a, b`) in a specific order:  

**Steps**:  
1. **Create a Sorting Column**:  
   Use Power Query or DAX to assign numerical values to the desired order.  
   ```dax  
   CategorySortOrder =  
   SWITCH(TRUE(),  
       [Category] = "c", 1,  
       [Category] = "d", 2,  
       [Category] = "a", 3,  
       [Category] = "b", 4,  
       99)  // Default value  
   ```  

2. **Apply "Sort by Column"**:  
   - In Power BI Desktop, select the `Category` column.  
   - Go to **Column tools** > **Sort by Column** > Choose `CategorySortOrder`.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This method ensures the visual respects the custom order.
