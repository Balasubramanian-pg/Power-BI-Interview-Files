## **4. Different Refresh Types in Power BI**  

The refresh type depends on the **Data Connection Mode** (Import, DirectQuery, Live Connection).  

**For Import Mode**:  
1. **Manual Refresh**: On-demand refresh via the Power BI Service.  
2. **Scheduled Refresh**:  
   - **Power BI Pro**: Up to 8 times/day.  
   - **Power BI Premium**: Up to 48 times/day.  
3. **Incremental Refresh** (Premium Feature): Refreshes only recent data partitions for large datasets.  

**For DirectQuery / Live Connection Mode**:  
- No data refresh; queries are sent to the source in real-time.  
- **Automatic Page Refresh**: Configurable interval to refresh visuals (e.g., every 5 minutes).  

> [!WARNING]  
> DirectQuery/Live Connection modes bypass the data model, so performance depends on the source system.
