## 35. How do **composite models with DirectLake** behave differently from Import + DirectQuery?

DirectLake is a new storage mode in Microsoft Fabric that fundamentally changes the trade-offs of composite models.

#### Traditional Composite Model (Import + DirectQuery)
*   **Architecture:** Combines in-memory VertiPaq data (Import) with live connections to a source database (DirectQuery).
*   **Behavior:**
    *   **Data Duplication:** Import tables represent a second copy of the data, which is stored inside the Power BI dataset.
    *   **Performance Dichotomy:** Queries hitting only Import tables are very fast. Queries hitting the DirectQuery source are subject to network latency and the performance of the source database. DAX has to be translated to SQL (or another native language).
    *   **Refresh & Latency:** The Import part of the model is only as fresh as the last scheduled refresh. The DirectQuery part is real-time.

#### Composite Model with DirectLake
*   **Architecture:** Combines tables from different Fabric artifacts where one or more are in DirectLake mode. DirectLake tables read data directly from Delta/Parquet files in OneLake.
*   **Behavioral Differences:**
    *   **No Data Duplication or Import:** This is the key difference. DirectLake mode does **not** import and copy the data into a VertiPaq cache. It reads the columnar Delta files in OneLake *directly*. This is like having VertiPaq performance without the import process.
    *   **Near Real-Time with No Refresh:** When the underlying Delta Lake table in OneLake is updated by a Spark job or a Fabric pipeline, the Power BI dataset sees the changes almost instantly. There is no need for a traditional dataset "refresh" to copy the data.
    *   **Consistently Fast Performance:** Because the Power BI engine is reading a highly optimized, columnar format (Parquet) directly from the lake, it doesn't need to translate DAX to SQL. Performance is much closer to Import mode than DirectQuery mode, even though the data is "live."
    *   **Simplified Architecture:** It removes the need to manage separate Import and DirectQuery sources and refresh schedules, unifying analytics on a single copy of the data in OneLake.

> **Analogy:**
> * **Import + DQ:** You have a local library of printed books (Import) and a high-speed terminal to a remote national library (DirectQuery).
> * **DirectLake:** Your local library's shelves are digital and are directly and instantly synced with the national library's catalog. You get the speed of having the book "locally" with the freshness of the central source.
