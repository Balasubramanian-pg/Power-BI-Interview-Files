## 4. How does **auto-exist** affect results in DAX when using multiple dimension filters?

#### What is Auto-Exist?
*   Auto-exist is a DAX engine optimization that works behind the scenes.
*   When you apply filters to multiple columns from the *same dimension table*, auto-exist ensures that DAX only considers combinations of values that actually exist in that table.
*   It creates an intersection of the filters *before* passing the resulting filter context to the fact table.

#### How it Affects Results
*   **Prevents Calculation of Non-Existent Combinations:** It makes queries more efficient by not wasting time evaluating data for impossible scenarios.
*   **Example:**
    *   Imagine a `Product` table with `[Color]` and `[Size]` columns.
    *   Let's say you sell "Red" shirts in size "L", but you do not sell any "Red" shirts in size "XL".
    *   If a user filters `Product[Color] = "Red"` and `Product[Size] = "XL"`, auto-exist sees that this combination does not exist in the `Product` table.
    *   Therefore, it will not even attempt to calculate `[Total Sales]` for this combination. The result will be `BLANK()` instantly, without querying the `Sales` fact table.

#### When it Doesn't Apply
*   The optimization only applies to filters on columns from the **same table**.
*   If you filter on `Product[Color] = "Red"` and a separate `Store[City] = "London"`, auto-exist does not apply between these two filters because they are from different tables. DAX will evaluate the sales for all red products and all London stores and find the intersection.
