## 22. How do **query reduction options** impact performance?

#### What are Query Reduction Options?
*   These are settings found in Power BI Desktop's Options menu designed to give report authors more control over when queries are sent.
*   They primarily address the "chattiness" of the Power BI interface, where every single click can trigger multiple DAX queries to update all visuals on a page.
*   The main options are:
    *   **Disable cross-highlighting/filtering by default:** Stops visuals from filtering each other automatically.
    *   **Add an "Apply" button to slicers:** Prevents a slicer from applying its filter until a user explicitly clicks "Apply."
    *   **Add an "Apply" button to the filter pane:** Does the same for the entire filter pane.

#### Impact on Performance
*   **Improved Authoring Experience:**
    *   This is the primary benefit. When building a complex report, especially in DirectQuery mode or on a slow machine, disabling automatic queries makes the Power BI Desktop interface dramatically more responsive.
    *   You can make multiple changes to filters, slicers, and visuals without waiting for every visual to re-render after each click.
*   **Reduced Load on Data Source (DirectQuery):**
    *   For DirectQuery models, this is critical. Instead of sending ten individual queries to the source database as a user ticks ten checkboxes in a slicer, the "Apply" button consolidates this into a single, more efficient query containing all ten filter conditions.
*   **Controlled User Experience (Published Report):**
    *   If you leave the "Apply" buttons on slicers or the filter pane, you pass this controlled interaction to the end-user.
    *   This can be beneficial for very large or slow reports where users need to make many selections before seeing the result, preventing them from having to wait for the report to update after each click.

> **Authoring vs. Consuming:**
> * Disabling cross-highlighting is primarily an **authoring optimization**. It doesn't typically carry over to the published report's default behavior.
> * Adding "Apply" buttons is both an **authoring and consuming optimization**, as the button remains visible and functional for end-users in the Power BI Service.
