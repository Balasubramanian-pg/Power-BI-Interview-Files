## 3. Whatâ€™s the role of **calculation groups** and how do they differ from field parameters?

#### Calculation Groups
*   **Role:** To reduce measure proliferation by applying a common calculation logic to any existing measure in the model.
*   **How they work:**
    *   You define a set of "Calculation Items" using DAX.
    *   Each Calculation Item contains a DAX expression that uses the `SELECTEDMEASURE()` function as a placeholder for whatever measure is currently in context.
    *   They are typically used for Time Intelligence (YTD, MTD, PY), currency conversion, or creating different versions of a calculation (e.g., Average, Rolling Average).
*   **Example:** Instead of creating `[Sales YTD]`, `[Profit YTD]`, and `[COGS YTD]`, you create a single Calculation Item called "YTD" with the formula: `CALCULATE(SELECTEDMEASURE(), DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))`. You can then use this with any base measure.

#### Field Parameters
*   **Role:** To allow report consumers to dynamically change the measures or dimensions used in visuals.
*   **How they work:**
    *   You create a disconnected table that contains the names of existing measures or columns.
    *   Users can then use a slicer based on this parameter table to choose which field they want to see on an axis or as a value in a chart.
*   **Example:** Create a field parameter with the measures `[Total Sales]`, `[Total Profit]`, and `[Total Quantity]`. A user can then select "Total Profit" from a slicer to change a bar chart's values from showing sales to showing profit.

> **Core Difference:**
> * **Calculation Groups:** Manipulate *how* a measure is calculated (the logic). They apply a transformation. `(Sales -> Sales YTD)`.
> * **Field Parameters:** Manipulate *which* measure or column is displayed. They swap out the field itself. `(Sales -> Profit)`.
