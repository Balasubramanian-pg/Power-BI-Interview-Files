### 31. Why might you use **group by in Power Query** rather than summarization in DAX?

This choice is about optimizing the model's size and performance by deciding when to perform aggregation.

#### Use Group By in Power Query When:
*   **You Need to Permanently Change the Grain:** The primary reason is to reduce the number of rows in your model.
    *   **Use Case:** You receive transactional data logged to the second, but your business analysis never goes below the daily level. The source table has 100 million rows. By using `Group By` in Power Query to group by `Date`, `Product`, and `Store` and summing the `Sales`, you might reduce the table to 1 million rows.
*   **The Aggregation is Static:** The grouping logic does not need to change based on user selections in the report.
*   **To Reduce Cardinality:** By grouping, you can often remove high-cardinality columns like `TransactionID`, which dramatically reduces model size and improves VertiPaq compression.

#### The Benefits of Pre-Aggregating in Power Query
*   **Smaller Model Size:** Fewer rows and lower cardinality columns lead to a much smaller memory footprint.
*   **Faster Refresh Times:** Power BI has less data to process, compress, and load into memory.
*   **Faster DAX Queries:** DAX measures running on the smaller, pre-aggregated table will be significantly faster because the engine has to scan far fewer rows at query time.

#### When to Use DAX for Summarization
*   Use DAX functions like `SUMMARIZE` or `GROUPBY` when the aggregation must be **dynamic** and respond to the user's filter context. This is for calculations inside measures, not for physical model design.

> **The Rule of Thumb:**
> * If you can pre-aggregate the data without losing any necessary detail for your analysis, **always do it as early as possible**, preferably in Power Query or even further upstream in the source database. This is a fundamental principle of performance tuning in Power BI.
