## 5. Whatâ€™s the behavior of **relationships with inactive joins**, and how do you activate them on the fly?

#### Behavior of Inactive Relationships
*   **Definition:** An inactive relationship is a relationship that exists in the data model but is not used by default to propagate filters between tables.
*   **Appearance:** In the model view, it is represented by a dashed line, whereas an active relationship is a solid line.
*   **Purpose:** They are used to resolve ambiguity when there are multiple valid filter paths between two tables. This is common in "role-playing dimensions."
*   **Example:** A `Sales` table might have both an `OrderDateKey` and a `ShipDateKey`. Both could be related to the `Date` table's `DateKey`. To avoid ambiguity, you would set one relationship (e.g., `OrderDateKey` to `DateKey`) as active and the other (`ShipDateKey` to `DateKey`) as inactive. By default, all calculations will be based on the order date.

#### Activating Them On-the-Fly
*   **Mechanism:** You activate an inactive relationship for the duration of a single DAX calculation using the `USERELATIONSHIP()` function.
*   **Syntax:** `USERELATIONSHIP()` is used as a filter argument inside a `CALCULATE` or `CALCULATETABLE` function.

> **Example DAX Measure:**
> * To calculate sales based on the ship date instead of the default order date, you would write the following measure:
> ```dax
> Sales by Ship Date =
> CALCULATE(
>     [Total Sales],
>     USERELATIONSHIP( 'Sales'[ShipDateKey], 'Date'[DateKey] )
> )
> ```
> * For this one calculation, DAX will ignore the active relationship on `OrderDateKey` and use the inactive one on `ShipDateKey`.
