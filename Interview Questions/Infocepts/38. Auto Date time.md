## 38. What are the pitfalls of using **auto date/time** vs. a custom date table?

Power BI's "auto date/time" feature is convenient for beginners but is widely considered an anti-pattern for serious model development due to several significant pitfalls.

#### How Auto Date/Time Works
*   For every `DateTime` column in your model, Power BI automatically and silently creates a hidden, separate date table in the background.
*   If you have five date columns in your model, Power BI creates five hidden date tables.
*   It also creates a built-in hierarchy (Year, Quarter, Month, Day) for each of these columns.

#### The Pitfalls
*   **Model Bloat:** Each hidden table adds to the model's size and memory consumption. Five date columns mean five full date tables, which is highly inefficient. A single, shared custom date table is much smaller.
*   **Inconsistent Time Intelligence:** Standard DAX time intelligence functions (`DATESYTD`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, etc.) require a proper, contiguous date table marked as such in the model. They will not work correctly with the hidden auto date/time tables. This is the biggest drawback.
*   **No Customization:** You cannot add custom columns to the hidden tables, such as fiscal year/quarter columns, week numbers, or working day flags. A custom date table gives you complete control to add any business-specific logic you need.
*   **Ambiguity and Confusion:** It can be confusing for authors to see hierarchies appear for date fields without understanding where they come from. It also makes it difficult to apply a single, consistent time filter across measures that rely on different date fields (e.g., `OrderDate` vs. `ShipDate`). A single date table with inactive relationships (`USERELATIONSHIP`) is the correct pattern for this.

> **The Verdict:**
> * **Always turn off "Auto date/time"** in the global and current file settings.
> * **Always create and use a dedicated, custom date table** (also known as a calendar dimension).
> * Mark your custom date table as the official date table in the model view (`Mark as Date Table`). This is non-negotiable for any serious Power BI development.
