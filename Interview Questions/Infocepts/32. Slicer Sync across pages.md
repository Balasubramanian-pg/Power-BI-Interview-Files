## 32. Whatâ€™s the difference between **slicer sync across pages** and **report filters**?

Both features apply filters across multiple pages, but they offer different user experiences and are used for different purposes.

#### Report-Level Filters
*   **Where it's set:** In the **Filters pane**, in the section titled "Filters on all pages."
*   **Visibility to User:** It can be visible to end-users in the filter pane, or the report author can lock and hide it.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Applies a persistent filter condition to every single page and visual in the report.
    *   It is a foundational, baseline filter.
*   **Use Case:** To set the overall context for the entire report. For example, filtering the entire report to the "Current Fiscal Year" or excluding test data (`[IsTestTransaction] = FALSE`). It's for rules that should always be active.

#### Slicer Sync
*   **Where it's set:** By adding a slicer to one page, then using the "Sync slicers" pane to make it visible and active on other pages.
*   **Visibility to User:** It is a highly visible, interactive UI element on the report canvas itself.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   When a user makes a selection in a synced slicer on Page 1, that same selection is automatically applied to the corresponding slicer on Page 2, Page 3, etc.
    *   It gives the user the *feeling* of a global, persistent slicer.
*   **Use Case:** To provide a common, interactive filtering mechanism for users to explore the data. For example, allowing users to select a `Region` or `Business Unit` on any page and have that choice persist as they navigate through the report. It's for user-driven exploration.

> **Key Difference:**
> * **Report Filter:** An author-defined, often hidden, **background rule** that sets the report's boundaries.
> * **Slicer Sync:** A user-facing, **interactive control** that provides a consistent exploration experience across pages.
