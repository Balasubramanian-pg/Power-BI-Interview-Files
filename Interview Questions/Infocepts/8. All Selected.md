## 8. Can you explain why **ALLSELECTED** behaves differently than ALL or REMOVEFILTERS?

#### ALL() and REMOVEFILTERS()
*   **Function:** These functions remove filters from the specified table or columns. `REMOVEFILTERS` is the newer, more explicit syntax for `ALL`.
*   **Behavior:** They ignore *all* filters that are currently applied to the column(s), regardless of where those filters come fromâ€”the current visual's context, slicers, or filters from other visuals.
*   **Use Case:** Calculating a grand total percentage. `[Sales] / CALCULATE([Sales], ALL('Product'))` will give you the sales of a specific product as a percentage of the sales of *all* products in the entire dataset.

#### ALLSELECTED()
*   **Function:** This function also removes filters, but it does so selectively.
*   **Behavior:** It removes the filters applied from the *inside* of the current visual (e.g., from the rows, columns, or legend of a chart) but *respects* the filters applied from the *outside* (e.g., from slicers or filters applied by other visuals on the report page).
*   **Use Case:** Calculating a percentage of a visible total. `[Sales] / CALCULATE([Sales], ALLSELECTED('Product'))` will give you the sales of a specific product as a percentage of the total for only the products currently selected in a slicer.

> **Practical Scenario:**
> * You have a bar chart of sales by product category and a slicer for `Country`.
> * The `Country` slicer is set to "USA".
> * **Using `ALL()`:** A measure `% of Grand Total = DIVIDE([Sales], CALCULATE([Sales], ALL(Product)))` will show each category's sales as a percentage of *all sales globally*.
> * **Using `ALLSELECTED()`:** A measure `% of Visible Total = DIVIDE([Sales], CALCULATE([Sales], ALLSELECTED(Product)))` will show each category's sales as a percentage of the total sales for the *USA only*.
