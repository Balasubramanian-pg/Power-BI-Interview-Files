## 9. What are the limits of **incremental refresh** when applied on partitioned tables in PBI Service?

#### Core Requirements and Limits
*   **Premium or PPU Only:** Incremental refresh is a premium feature and is not available in Power BI Pro workspaces.
*   **Query Folding is Mandatory:** The Power Query steps that filter the table based on the `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` parameters *must* be able to be folded back to the data source. If a non-foldable step occurs before the filtering, the refresh will fail.
*   **DateTime Parameters Required:** You must have `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` parameters of the `DateTime` data type defined in Power Query.
*   **Single Table Limitation:** The policy is configured on a per-table basis. You cannot define a single policy that applies to multiple tables simultaneously.

#### Partition and Data-Related Limits
*   **Data Source Must Support Date Filtering:** The underlying data source must be able to efficiently handle the date-based queries generated by Power BI (e.g., a SQL database with an index on the date column).
*   **"Detect Data Changes" Limitations:**
    *   This optional feature, which refreshes only historical partitions that have changed, requires a separate `datetime` column that indicates the last update time (e.g., `LastModifiedDate`).
    *   This column must also be query-foldable.
*   **Partition Management:**
    *   Power BI Service manages the partitions automatically. You cannot manually create, delete, or modify partitions in the service.
    *   The service has internal limits on the number of partitions a dataset can have, which can be a consideration for very long-term policies with daily granularity (though these limits are high, typically in the hundreds).
*   **XMLA Endpoint:** While you can't *manually* create partitions, you can use the XMLA endpoint (a Premium feature) with tools like Tabular Editor or SSMS to perform more advanced partitioning strategies or to trigger more granular refreshes.
