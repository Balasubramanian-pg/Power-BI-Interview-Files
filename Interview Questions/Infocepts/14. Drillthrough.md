## 14. Can you describe a use case where **cross-report drillthrough** makes sense?

#### What is Cross-Report Drillthrough?
*   It's a feature that allows a user to navigate from a data point in a source report to a page in a different target report within the same Power BI workspace.
*   Crucially, the filter context from the source visual (the data point you right-clicked on) is passed to the target report, which arrives pre-filtered.

#### Key Use Cases
*   **Summary-to-Detail Architecture ("Hub and Spoke"):**
    *   **Use Case:** An organization has a high-level executive dashboard (the "Hub" report) showing key KPIs like total sales, profit margin, and market share by region.
    *   When an executive sees an anomaly (e.g., low profit margin in the "West" region), they can right-click on the "West" region data point.
    *   They can then use a cross-report drillthrough to navigate to a highly detailed, multi-page "West Region Operational Report" (the "Spoke").
    *   This target report opens already filtered to the "West" region, allowing for immediate deep-dive analysis without the user needing to re-apply filters. This keeps the executive dashboard clean and uncluttered while providing a seamless path to detailed information.
*   **Connecting Centralized and Departmental Reports:**
    *   **Use Case:** A central Finance report shows overall company spending. Different departments (IT, Marketing, HR) maintain their own detailed spending reports with department-specific categories and visuals.
    *   A manager in the central Finance team can view the total spending for the "Marketing" department in the main report.
    *   They can then drill through to the dedicated "Marketing Campaign ROI Report." The context of the month and department is passed along, allowing them to see the specific campaign details that contributed to the total cost.
*   **Maintaining a Single Source of Truth for Dimensions:**
    *   **Use Case:** You have a "Master Product Report" that contains all specifications, inventory levels, and details for every product.
    *   Multiple other reports (Sales, Manufacturing, Returns) use product information.
    *   From any of these reports, a user can right-click a product and drill through to its master page in the "Master Product Report" to get the full, official details, ensuring everyone is looking at the same source of truth.
