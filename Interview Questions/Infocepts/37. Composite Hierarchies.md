### 37. How do **composite hierarchies** behave when you use field parameters?

This is a specific scenario where two advanced features interact, and the behavior can be non-intuitive.

#### The Setup
*   **Composite Hierarchy:** A hierarchy created in the data model that combines columns from multiple, related tables. For example, a `Geography` hierarchy might have `Region[RegionName]` (from the Region table) and `Country[CountryName]` (from the Country table).
*   **Field Parameters:** A feature that allows users to dynamically select which columns or measures are displayed in a visual.

#### The Behavior and Limitation
*   **The Problem:** You cannot directly include a composite hierarchy itself as one of the options in a field parameter. The field parameter setup UI only allows you to select individual columns or measures.
*   **The Interaction:**
    1.  You can, however, include the *individual columns* that make up the hierarchy in your field parameter (e.g., `RegionName`, `CountryName`, `City`).
    2.  A user can then place this field parameter on the axis of a visual.
    3.  **Crucially, the visual will not behave like a native hierarchy.** When the user selects "RegionName," they will see the regions. When they select "CountryName," the visual will switch to show countries.
    4.  They will **lose the ability to drill down** from Region -> Country -> City within a single visual state. The field parameter swaps the entire axis field; it does not enable hierarchical drill-down behavior on the selected fields.

> **Workaround/Solution:**
> * If you need to offer users a choice between different drill-down paths, you cannot use a single field parameter.
> * Instead, you would typically use **bookmarks** combined with buttons.
> * Create one version of the chart with the `Geography` hierarchy. Create another version with a `Product` hierarchy.
> * Create two buttons, "View by Geography" and "View by Product."
> * Link each button to a bookmark that shows the corresponding chart and hides the other. This simulates the dynamic choice while preserving the full hierarchical drill-down functionality.
