## 10. What’s the difference between **row-level security (RLS)** and **object-level security (OLS)**?

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)
*   **What it Secures:** The *rows* of data within a table.
*   **User Experience:** All users see the same report structure, visuals, columns, and measures. However, the data shown *within* those visuals is filtered based on their identity. A sales manager for the USA sees the same sales report as the manager for Canada, but they only see data for their respective countries.
*   **Implementation:** Implemented directly within Power BI Desktop using DAX expressions to define roles. You create a rule (a DAX filter expression) that evaluates to `TRUE` for the rows a user is allowed to see.
*   **Primary Goal:** Data security and personalization.

#### Object-Level Security (OLS)
*   **What it Secures:** The *objects* of the model itself—entire tables, columns, or measures.
*   **User Experience:** If a user is denied access to an object, it is as if that object does not exist for them. A report visual that uses a restricted column will break, and the column will not appear in the field list.
*   **Implementation:** Not implemented in Power BI Desktop. It is configured using third-party tools like Tabular Editor or via Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) connected to the dataset's XMLA endpoint (a Premium feature).
*   **Primary Goal:** Metadata security and simplifying the model for different user groups (e.g., hiding complex or sensitive columns like employee salaries from general business users).

> **Analogy:**
> * **RLS:** Two people reading the same phone book, but one person has all the listings for "Smith" blacked out with a marker. They know the "Smiths" exist but can't see the details.
> * **OLS:** One person is given a phone book where the entire "S" section has been physically torn out. To them, no one with a last name starting with "S" even exists.
