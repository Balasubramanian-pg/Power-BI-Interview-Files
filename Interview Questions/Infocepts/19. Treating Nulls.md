## 19. Whatâ€™s the practical difference between **treating nulls in Power Query vs. DAX**?

Although they both represent "missing" data, `null` in M (Power Query) and `BLANK()` in DAX (the data model) behave very differently.

#### Nulls in Power Query (M)
*   **Nature:** `null` is a distinct, scalar value.
*   **Behavior in Comparisons:**
    *   You can directly compare it: `[Column] = null` will correctly evaluate to `true` or `false`.
    *   `null = null` evaluates to `true`.
*   **Behavior in Operations:**
    *   In mathematical operations, `1 + null` results in `null`.
    *   In text concatenations, ` "text" & null ` results in `null`.
*   **Handling:** It is treated like any other value. You can filter for it, count it, and replace it easily using functions like `Table.ReplaceValue`.
*   **Context:** It's a data-cleansing and preparation concept. The goal is often to eliminate `nulls` before the data ever reaches the DAX model.

#### BLANK() in DAX
*   **Nature:** `BLANK()` is more of a "state" than a value. It represents a missing value, an empty cell, or a non-existent combination.
*   **Behavior in Comparisons:**
    *   Direct comparison doesn't work as expected: `[Column] = BLANK()` is not the correct way to check for a blank value and may not yield the right results.
    *   The correct way to check is with the `ISBLANK()` function: `IF(ISBLANK([Column]), ...)`
    *   `BLANK() = BLANK()` evaluates to `false`.
*   **Behavior in Operations:**
    *   DAX tries to be helpful, which can be confusing. In mathematical operations, `BLANK()` is often implicitly converted to zero (0). For example, `1 + BLANK()` results in `1`.
    *   In aggregations, `AVERAGE` ignores `BLANKs` (they don't count towards the total or the count), while `COUNT` does not count `BLANKs`. `COUNTROWS` will count the row even if it contains `BLANKs`.
*   **Context:** It's an analytical concept. `BLANK()` values naturally appear in visuals when there is no data for a given combination of dimension attributes (e.g., a product that wasn't sold in a particular month).

> **Practical Implication:**
> * Always handle and cleanse your `null` values in Power Query first. Decide if they should be zeros, a specific text like "N/A", or if the rows should be removed.
> * Be very careful with how you handle `BLANK()` in your DAX measures, as the implicit conversion to zero can skew results like averages or lead to division-by-zero errors if not handled explicitly.
