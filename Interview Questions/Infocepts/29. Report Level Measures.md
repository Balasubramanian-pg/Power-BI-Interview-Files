### 29. When can **report-level measures** (thin report connected to dataset) cause versioning headaches?

#### The "Thin Report" Architecture
*   This is a best practice where you create a centralized, "golden" Power BI dataset and then build multiple, smaller `.pbix` files (thin reports) that connect to it via a Live Connection.
*   **Report-level measures** are DAX measures created directly inside one of these thin reports, rather than in the central dataset.

#### The Versioning Headaches
*   **Lack of a Single Source of Truth:**
    *   If a business user needs a new calculation, like "Sales in USD," a report author might create it as a report-level measure in `Report A`.
    *   Another author, working on `Report B`, needs the same calculation. Unaware of the measure in `Report A`, they create their own version.
    *   You now have two versions of the same business logic, which can diverge over time, leading to inconsistent reporting.
*   **No Reusability:** A report-level measure created in `Report A` is completely unavailable to `Report B` or any other report. This leads to massive duplication of effort.
*   **Governance and Maintenance Nightmare:**
    *   If the underlying dataset changes (e.g., a column name is updated), you have to go into every single `.pbix` file that contains report-level measures and fix them individually.
    *   There is no central place to manage, document, or validate these calculations.
*   **Breaks Composite Model Chaining:** You cannot create a composite model (DirectQuery over Power BI Datasets) on a thin report that contains report-level measures. This limits your ability to extend the model.

> **Best Practice:**
> * **Prohibit Report-Level Measures:** As a rule, all business logic and DAX calculations should reside in the central, shared dataset.
> * The only exception might be extremely specific, one-off measures used for visual formatting or a single, non-reusable purpose within one report. Even then, it should be done with caution.
> * Thin reports should be for **visualization and presentation only**.
