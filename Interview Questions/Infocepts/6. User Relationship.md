## 6. When would you use **USERELATIONSHIP** inside CALCULATE vs. creating a new relationship?

#### Use USERELATIONSHIP When:
*   **You have a "Role-Playing Dimension":** This is the primary use case. A single dimension table (like `Date` or `Customer`) plays multiple roles in relation to a fact table (e.g., `Order Date` vs. `Ship Date`, or `Buyer` vs. `Seller`).
*   **The Alternative Path is Secondary:** The active relationship represents the primary, most common business question (e.g., "Sales by Order Date"). The inactive paths are for specific, less frequent analytical needs (e.g., "Sales by Ship Date").
*   **You Want to Keep the Model Simple:** It avoids the need to duplicate your dimension tables (e.g., creating a `Ship Date` table that is an exact copy of the `Date` table), which keeps the model cleaner and smaller.

#### Consider Creating a New (Active) Relationship When:
*   **The Business Concepts are Genuinely Different:** If the tables you are connecting represent truly distinct entities, they should have their own active relationships. For example, if you have a `Sales` fact and a `Budget` fact, they should both have their own active relationships to the `Date` table.
*   **Performance is a Critical Issue (Rare):** In extremely complex models with heavy use of `USERELATIONSHIP`, there might be a minor performance overhead. Creating a second, physical copy of the dimension table could be marginally faster, but this comes at the cost of increased model size and complexity. This is generally an edge case and not a primary reason.
*   **Users Need to Slice and Dice by Both Simultaneously:** If a user needs to build a matrix with "Order Date" on rows and "Ship Date" on columns, the `USERELATIONSHIP` approach won't work directly. In this scenario, you would need two physical copies of the date table (`Order Date Table` and `Ship Date Table`), each with an active relationship to the fact table.
