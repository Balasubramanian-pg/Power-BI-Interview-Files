## 2. Can you explain the difference between **DirectQuery with composite models** vs. **Hybrid tables**?

#### DirectQuery with Composite Models
*   **Purpose:** To combine data from *multiple different sources* within a single Power BI model.
*   **Mechanism:** It allows you to mix and match storage modes at the *table level*.
    *   Some tables can be in **Import** mode (data is loaded into Power BI's memory).
    *   Other tables can be in **DirectQuery** mode (data stays in the source system).
    *   You can even have tables in **Dual** mode (acts as Import or DirectQuery depending on the query context).
*   **Use Case:** Integrating a corporate SQL Data Warehouse (DirectQuery for real-time sales data) with a departmental Excel file (Import for sales targets).

#### Hybrid Tables
*   **Purpose:** To optimize performance and data freshness for a *single large table*.
*   **Mechanism:** It works by partitioning a single table into different storage modes.
    *   **Historical Partition (Import):** The bulk of the old, static data is imported into memory for maximum query speed.
    *   **Real-time Partition (DirectQuery):** The most recent data (e.g., today's transactions) is left in DirectQuery mode, so visuals always show the latest information without a full model refresh.
*   **Prerequisites:** Requires Incremental Refresh to be configured on the table.
*   **Use Case:** An event log table with billions of historical rows. You import everything up to yesterday for fast analysis and use DirectQuery for the partition containing today's data to get real-time updates.

> **Key Distinction:**
> * **Composite Models:** Mix storage modes for *different tables* from potentially *different sources*.
> * **Hybrid Tables:** Mix storage modes for *different partitions* within a *single table*.
