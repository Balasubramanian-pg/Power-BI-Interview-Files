## 16. How can **composite models** break query folding, and how do you troubleshoot that?

#### How Composite Models Break Query Folding
*   **The "Folding Wall":** Query folding works by translating M steps into a single query for a *single source*. A composite model, by definition, involves data from at least two different sources or storage modes (e.g., DirectQuery and Import).
*   **The Breaking Point:** The moment a Power Query transformation needs to combine data from a foldable source (like a SQL Server) with data from another source, folding stops cold.
    *   **Example 1: Merging DQ and Import:** You have a `Sales` table in DirectQuery mode from SQL Server and an `Sales Targets` table imported from an Excel file. When you perform a `Table.NestedJoin` (Merge Queries) step to combine them, Power BI cannot send a single query to SQL Server that includes data from a local Excel file.
    *   **Consequence:** To perform the merge, Power BI's mashup engine must first execute the folded query against the SQL server to retrieve *all the data up to that point*. It then pulls that data into its own memory and performs the merge locally with the Excel data. This negates the primary benefit of DirectQuery/folding, which is to keep data at the source.

#### Troubleshooting Steps
*   **Use the Query Diagnostics Tools:**
    *   In Power Query, go to the `Tools` tab and click `Start Diagnostics`. Perform the steps (like merging tables), then click `Stop Diagnostics`.
    *   This will generate detailed diagnostic tables that show you the queries being sent to the data source. You can see the native queries and identify which parts are being folded.
*   **Check "View Native Query" Step-by-Step:**
    *   This is the simplest method. Start from the first step in your query and right-click on each subsequent step.
    *   Observe at which step the `View Native Query` option becomes greyed out. This is your "folding breaker". The step immediately preceding it was the last successful folded operation.
*   **Reorder Steps Strategically:**
    *   Try to perform as many foldable transformations as possible *before* the step that breaks folding.
    *   For example, filter your SQL table and remove unnecessary columns first. Only then, as the last step, merge it with the data from the non-foldable source. This ensures the query sent to the SQL server is as efficient as possible.
*   **Consider Dataflows:**
    *   In some scenarios, you can use Power BI Dataflows to pre-combine and clean data. You can merge the SQL and Excel data in a dataflow. Then, in your Power BI Desktop file, you can connect to this single, pre-processed dataflow entity, which can simplify the model and query logic.
