## 1. How does the *query folding* process impact performance when combining M transformations?

#### What is Query Folding?
*   Query folding is the process where Power Query's M transformations are translated into a single, native query in the source system's language (e.g., SQL, OData, T-SQL).
*   Instead of Power BI pulling the entire table and then performing transformations step-by-step in its own engine, it sends one consolidated command to the data source.
*   The data source then executes this single, optimized query and returns only the final, transformed result set to Power BI.

#### Impact on Performance
*   **Reduced Data Transfer:** Power BI only imports the final, necessary data, not the entire raw table. This dramatically reduces network traffic and load times.
*   **Leverages Source System Power:** It offloads the processing work (filtering, sorting, joining) to the source database, which is often a powerful server optimized for these tasks.
*   **Enables Incremental Refresh:** Query folding is a mandatory prerequisite for setting up incremental refresh on a table in the Power BI Service. Without it, Power BI cannot construct the date-filtered queries needed to partition the data.

#### How M Transformations Affect It
*   **Foldable Transformations:** Many common steps can be folded.
    *   Filtering rows (`Table.SelectRows`)
    *   Removing or choosing columns (`Table.RemoveColumns`, `Table.SelectColumns`)
    *   Grouping and aggregating (`Table.Group`)
    *   Merging/joining tables from the same source (`Table.NestedJoin`)
    *   Simple mathematical operations.
*   **Non-Foldable Transformations ("Folding Breakers"):** Certain steps cannot be translated into the native source language and will break the folding process.
    *   Applying an M function that has no native equivalent (e.g., `Table.AddIndexColumn`).
    *   Changing a column's data type in a way the source can't handle.
    *   Merging data from two different sources (e.g., a SQL table with a CSV file).

> **How to check for Query Folding:**
> * In the Power Query Editor, right-click on the last applied step.
> * If the `View Native Query` option is enabled (not greyed out), query folding is active for all steps up to that point.
> * The step where `View Native Query` becomes disabled is the "folding breaker".
