### 28. How do **inactive measures** inside calculation groups work?

This is a specific and powerful feature for controlling the behavior of calculation items.

#### The Default Behavior
*   By default, when you apply a calculation group to a visual, it applies one of its calculation items to **every single measure** used in that visual.
*   For example, if you have a `Time Intelligence` calculation group and a visual with `[Total Sales]` and `[Units Sold]`, selecting the "YTD" item will transform both measures into `[Total Sales YTD]` and `[Units Sold YTD]`.

#### The Problem
*   Sometimes, this is not what you want. You might have a measure, like `[Sales vs Budget %]`, that should *not* be transformed by the time intelligence logic. Applying a `YTD` calculation to a percentage that is already a ratio often produces nonsensical results.

#### The Solution: Inactive Measures
*   **Mechanism:** Inside the Tabular Model definition (which you can access with Tabular Editor), you can specify a list of "inactive measures" for a specific calculation item.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  Select a calculation item (e.g., "YTD").
    2.  In its properties, you can provide a list of base measures (e.g., `[Sales vs Budget %]`).
    3.  When the "YTD" calculation item is applied, the engine checks if the measure in context (`SELECTEDMEASURE()`) is in this inactive list.
    4.  If it is, the calculation item's expression is **ignored**, and the original base measure is returned instead.
*   **Result:** In a visual, `[Total Sales]` becomes `[Total Sales YTD]`, but `[Sales vs Budget %]` remains `[Sales vs Budget %]`, preserving its original logic. This gives you granular control over how the calculation group behaves.
