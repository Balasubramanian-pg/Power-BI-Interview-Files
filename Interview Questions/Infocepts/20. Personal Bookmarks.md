## 20. Can you explain the difference between **personal bookmarks, report bookmarks, and persistent filters**?

These three features all save the state of a report, but they serve different purposes and are aimed at different users.

#### Report Bookmarks
*   **Creator:** The report **author** in Power BI Desktop.
*   **Scope:** Part of the saved `.pbix` file. They are available to **all** consumers who view the published report.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Captures a specific state of a report page: filter selections, slicer states, sort order, visual visibility (show/hide), focus mode, and drillthrough location.
    *   Can be used to create guided navigation, storytelling experiences (like a slide show), or saved views of key insights.
    *   Can be linked to buttons and images for interactive navigation.

#### Personal Bookmarks
*   **Creator:** A report **consumer** (a viewer) in the Power BI Service.
*   **Scope:** Tied to the specific user's account and only visible to them. They do not modify the original report for anyone else.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Allows a user to save their own personalized view of a report. If a user always filters a report to their specific sales region and product line, they can apply those filters once and save it as a personal bookmark.
    *   They can even make a personal bookmark their "default view," so the report always opens in that state for them.
    *   It empowers users to customize their experience without needing edit permissions on the report.

#### Persistent Filters
*   **Creator:** This is an **automatic system feature** in the Power BI Service.
*   **Scope:** User-specific and automatic. It's part of the user's session state.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   When a user interacts with a report (applies filters, uses slicers) and then leaves, the Power BI Service automatically remembers those settings.
    *   The next time that same user opens the report, their last-used filters are still applied.
    *   This is purely a convenience feature to save users from having to re-apply common filters every time they open a report.
    *   It can be cleared by the user at any time by clicking the "Reset to default" button, which reverts the report back to the state published by the author.

> **In a Nutshell:**
> * **Report Bookmark:** Author-created, for everyone, used for storytelling and navigation.
> * **Personal Bookmark:** Consumer-created, for personal use, used for saving customized views.
> * **Persistent Filters:** System-created, automatic, used for user convenience and session stickiness.
