## 24. Why might **summarize columns in Power Query** behave differently than SUMMARIZE in DAX?

While both tools can perform grouping and aggregation, they operate at different stages and with different philosophies, leading to key behavioral differences.

#### Summarize Columns in Power Query (Group By)
*   **When it Operates:** During data refresh, as a permanent, physical transformation of the data being loaded into the model.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   It creates a **new, static table**. The result is what gets loaded into the VertiPaq engine.
    *   It is not dynamic. It cannot react to filters or slicers in the report.
    *   The aggregation is pre-calculated and materialized.
*   **Use Case:** Use this when you need to permanently change the grain of a table before it enters the model. For example, if you have transactional data at the second level but only ever need to analyze it at the daily level, you can use "Group By" in Power Query to pre-aggregate it. This makes the model smaller and faster.

#### SUMMARIZE Function in DAX
*   **When it Operates:** At query time, dynamically, in response to a user's interaction with the report.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   It generates a **virtual table** in memory for the duration of a single DAX query. This table is not stored in the model.
    *   It is **fully dynamic**. The table it generates respects the current filter context (slicers, filters, etc.). If a user filters by "2023", `SUMMARIZE` will only operate on the data for 2023.
    *   It can include complex DAX expressions for its aggregation columns.
*   **Use Case:** Use this inside a measure (often with an iterator like `SUMX`) to perform multi-level aggregations or to create intermediate tables needed for a complex calculation.

> **Core Distinction:**
> * **Power Query Group By:** A permanent, ETL-time operation to reshape the physical model. It's about data *preparation*.
> * **DAX SUMMARIZE:** A temporary, query-time operation to generate a virtual table for a dynamic calculation. It's about data *analysis*.
