Here is a structured and professional breakdown of the **scenario-based question**: _"How do you calculate Total YTD, QTD, or MTD values in DirectQuery mode in Power BI?"_

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **INTERVIEW QUESTION CONTEXT**

> Scenario:
> 
> You're working with a Power BI report in **DirectQuery mode**, and you are asked to calculate:

- **Total Year-to-Date (YTD)**
- **Total Quarter-to-Date (QTD)**
- **Total Month-to-Date (MTD)**
    
    However, as per Power BIâ€™s limitations, **Time Intelligence functions like** `**TOTALYTD()**` **cannot be used** in DirectQuery mode.
    

---

## âœ… **APPROACH IN IMPORT MODE (FOR COMPARISON)**

### DAX Measure (Import Mode):

```Plain
Total YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Calendar'[Date])
```

- `TOTALYTD()` works only in Import mode because it's a time intelligence function.
- Uses a date table that is marked as a date table.

---

## ðŸš« **CHALLENGE IN DIRECTQUERY MODE**

> Limitation:
> 
> You cannot use `TOTALYTD`, `DATESYTD`, `DATESMTD`, `TOTALQTD`, etc. in DirectQuery.
> 
> You must **manually simulate** the logic using `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and `MAX()`.

---

## âœ… **SOLUTION IN DIRECTQUERY MODE**

### ðŸ”§ **DAX Measure: Total YTD**

```Plain
Total YTD Direct =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER(
        ALL('Calendar'),
        'Calendar'[Year] = MAX('Calendar'[Year]) &&
        'Calendar'[Date] <= MAX('Calendar'[Date])
    )
)
```

### ðŸ§¾ **Explanation:**

- `ALL('Calendar')`: Removes row context to allow correct filtering.
- `Year = MAX(Year)`: Limits calculation to the current year.
- `Date <= MAX(Date)`: Includes all dates up to the selected context date.

## âœ… **SOLUTION FOR TOTAL MTD**

### ðŸ”§ **DAX Measure: Total MTD**

```Plain
Total MTD Direct =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER(
        ALL('Calendar'),
        'Calendar'[Year] = MAX('Calendar'[Year]) &&
        'Calendar'[Month] = MAX('Calendar'[Month]) &&
        'Calendar'[Date] <= MAX('Calendar'[Date])
    )
)
```

---

## âœ… **SOLUTION FOR TOTAL QTD**

### ðŸ”§ **DAX Measure: Total QTD**

```Plain
Total QTD Direct =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales],
    FILTER(
        ALL('Calendar'),
        'Calendar'[Year] = MAX('Calendar'[Year]) &&
        'Calendar'[Quarter] = MAX('Calendar'[Quarter]) &&
        'Calendar'[Date] <= MAX('Calendar'[Date])
    )
)
```

## ðŸ§  **Key Insights for Interview:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Topic|Explanation|
|Time Intelligence in DirectQuery|Not supported. Need to replicate manually with `CALCULATE` + `FILTER`|
|Performance Consideration|Keep Calendar table light; DirectQuery performance depends on SQL backend|
|Calendar Table|Must include columns like `Year`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Date`|
|Measure Reusability|Design `[Total Sales]` as a separate base measure (`SUM(Sales[Amount])`)|
