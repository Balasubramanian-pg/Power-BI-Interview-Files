### 2. What is column profiling?

Column Profiling is a set of data investigation features within the **Power Query Editor**. It allows you to deeply analyze the content and quality of your data on a column-by-column basis _before_ loading it into the data model. This is crucial for data cleaning and understanding.

Key features of Column Profiling include:

- **Column Quality:** Found in the "View" tab of Power Query. It adds a small bar under each column header showing the percentage of rows that are:
    - **Valid:** The data is of the correct data type.
    - **Error:** The data could not be converted to the selected data type (e.g., text "abc" in a number column).
    - **Empty:** The cell is null or empty.
- **Column Distribution:** Also in the "View" tab. It provides a chart showing the distribution of values and gives two key counts:
    - **Distinct:** The number of different values in the column (e.g., in `[Red, Blue, Red, Green]`, there are 3 distinct values).
    - **Unique:** The number of values that appear only once (in the same example, `[Blue, Green]` are unique, so the count is 2).
- **Column Profile (Full Pane):** This gives the most detailed view. When you select a column, it shows:
    - **Value Distribution:** A bar chart showing the frequency of each value.
    - **Column Statistics:** A table with metrics like Count, Error, Empty, Distinct, Unique, Min, Max, Average, Standard Deviation, etc. (depending on the data type).

**Why it's important:** It helps you quickly identify issues like unexpected nulls, data entry errors, outliers, and the cardinality (uniqueness) of columns, which is essential for creating effective relationships in your model.
