### 6. What is the difference between LOOKUPVALUE and RELATED function?

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|`RELATED()`|`LOOKUPVALUE()`|
|**Requirement**|An **active, existing relationship** must be in place between the tables.|**No relationship is required.** It works by matching values.|
|**Context**|Works within a **row context** (e.g., in a calculated column).|Can be used in either a row or filter context.|
|**Direction**|Follows the path of a **many-to-one** relationship. You cannot use it on the "one" side to get a value from the "many" side.|Can look up a value in any table, regardless of direction or relationship.|
|**Performance**|**Very fast and highly optimized.** It uses the pre-built indexes of the relationship in the VertiPaq engine.|**Slower than** `**RELATED**`**.** It has to perform a scan/search of the target column for the matching value.|
|**Use Case**|The **standard and preferred** way to bring a value from a dimension table into a fact table for a calculated column.|Used when a relationship doesn't exist, is inactive, or when dealing with complex many-to-many scenarios where a simple relationship is not possible.|

**Bottom Line:** Always use `RELATED` if a proper relationship exists. It is significantly more performant. Use `LOOKUPVALUE` as a powerful but more costly alternative when relationships are not an option.
