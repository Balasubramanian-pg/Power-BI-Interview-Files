### 17. If you want to apply the same slicer across multiple pages, how will you achieve that?

You achieve this using the **Sync Slicers** feature.

**The Process:**

1. **Create and format the slicer** on one of the pages (your "source" page).
2. With the slicer visual selected, go to the **View** tab in the Power BI Desktop ribbon.
3. Check the box for the **Sync slicers** pane. This will open a new pane on the right.
4. The Sync slicers pane shows a list of all pages in your report. For each page, there are two checkboxes next to your selected slicer:
    - **Sync (Chain icon):** This controls the _filtering_. If you check this box for a page, any selection made on the slicer will filter the visuals on that page, even if the slicer isn't visible there.
    - **Visible (Eye icon):** This controls the _visibility_ of the slicer visual itself. If you check this box, a copy of the slicer will appear on that page.
5. **Configure as Needed:**
    - To have one master slicer on Page 1 that filters Pages 1, 2, and 3: Keep it visible only on Page 1, but check the "Sync" box for all three pages.
    - To have the exact same slicer appear and be in sync on Pages 1, 2, and 3: Check both the "Sync" and "Visible" boxes for all three pages.

This powerful feature ensures a consistent user experience and saves you from having to manually set filters on every page.
