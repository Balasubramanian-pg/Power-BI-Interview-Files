### 15. Suppose someone with a contributor role who is not part of your team can view the data and dashboard. If yes, what should be done?

**Yes, someone with a Contributor role can absolutely view the data and dashboard.** In fact, they can do much more than that. A **Contributor** can:

- View, edit, delete, and create content within the workspace (reports, dashboards, datasets).
- Publish reports to the workspace.
- Create and share Apps.

They cannot, however, manage user permissions (that requires a Member or Admin role).

**What should be done? (The Solution)**

The core issue here is a violation of the **Principle of Least Privilege**. Users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their jobs. A user who only needs to _view_ a report should not be a Contributor.

**The Action Plan:**

1. **Identify the User and the Reason:** Determine why this user was given the Contributor role. It may have been a mistake or a temporary elevation of privilege that was never revoked.
2. **Communicate:** Inform the user and their manager that their role is being adjusted to reflect their actual needs, which is to view reports.
3. **Change the Role:**
    - Go to the Power BI workspace.
    - Click the **Access** button.
    - Find the user (or the group they are in).
    - Change their assigned role from **Contributor** to **Viewer**.
4. **Educate the Team:** Use this as a teaching moment to educate the workspace administrators on the differences between Power BI roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer) and the importance of applying the Principle of Least Privilege to protect data integrity and security.
