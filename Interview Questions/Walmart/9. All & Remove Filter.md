### 9. What is the difference between ALL and REMOVEFILTERS?

Functionally, when used as a filter modifier inside `CALCULATE`, they do the same thing: they remove filters from a table or column. The difference is in their syntax, readability, and versatility.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|`ALL()`|`REMOVEFILTERS()`|
|**Primary Use**|Can be used as a **table function** (returns a full, unfiltered table) OR as a `**CALCULATE**` **modifier**.|Can **only** be used as a `CALCULATE` modifier. It's syntactic sugar.|
|**Readability**|Less clear. `ALL` can be ambiguous. Does it mean all rows, or remove all filters?|Very clear. Its name explicitly states its purpose: removing filters. This is considered a best practice for clean code.|
|**Versatility**|More versatile. You can use it to return a table for use in other functions, e.g., `COUNTROWS(ALL(Customers))`.|Less versatile, as it only works inside `CALCULATE`.|
|**Example**|`CALCULATE([Sales], ALL(Products))`|`CALCULATE([Sales], REMOVEFILTERS(Products))`|

**Recommendation:**

- When your intent is to **remove filters inside** `**CALCULATE**`, use `REMOVEFILTERS` for better code readability.
- When you need to get an **unfiltered table as an input** for another function (like `SUMX` or `COUNTROWS`), you must use `ALL`.
