### End-to-End Explanation: "Most Critical Challenge Faced in a Power BI Project"

### **1. Setting the Context (Briefly Describe the Project)**

_Example:_

> "In a recent sales performance dashboard project, we had to analyze 50M+ rows of transactional data from multiple regions, with complex business logic for KPIs like YoY growth and customer segmentation."

### **2. The Specific Challenge (Be Detailed)**

_Example:_

> "The main challenge was slow report performance—users waited 3-5 minutes for visuals to load. The root causes were:
> 
> - _Calculated columns instead of measures_
> - _No query folding in Power Query transformations_
> - _DirectQuery on a poorly optimized SQL view_
> - _Too many visuals on a single page_

### **3. Actions Taken (Step-by-Step Solution)**

_Break down your troubleshooting and fixes:_

**a. Data Model Optimization**

> Replaced calculated columns with DAX measuresSwitched to a star schema (separated fact/dim tables)Set proper data types (e.g., integers instead of text for IDs)

**b. Performance Tuning**

> Used DAX Studio to identify slow measures (e.g., complex FILTER logic)Rewrote measures using variables (VAR) to avoid redundant calculationsImplemented incremental refresh (only updated new data)

**c. Query Optimization**

> Enabled query folding in Power Query (e.g., filtering data before import)Replaced DirectQuery with Import mode for static dataUsed aggregations for summary-level data

**d. Visualization Improvements**

> Reduced visuals per page (used bookmarks for navigation)Applied filters at the page level instead of visual levelUsed slicers with "Single select" to limit queries

### **4. Results (Quantify the Impact)**

_Example:_

> "After optimization:
> 
> - _Report load time dropped from **5 minutes to 15 seconds**_
> - _Data refresh time reduced by **70%**_
> - _User complaints decreased by **90%**_

### **5. Lessons Learned (Key Takeaways)**

> "Always test with real data volumes during development.""DAX measures are faster than calculated columns.""Query folding is a must for large datasets."

### 1. How will you publish the dashboard?

Publishing in Power BI is a multi-step process that involves moving your work from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

1. **Develop in Power BI Desktop:** First, you create your report in Power BI Desktop. This involves connecting to data sources, transforming data in Power Query, creating the data model (relationships, measures), and designing the report visuals on various pages.
2. **Publish from Desktop:**
    - In Power BI Desktop, on the **Home** ribbon, you click the **Publish** button.
    - You will be prompted to sign in to your Power BI Service account (e.g., `yourname@yourcompany.com`).
    - After signing in, a dialog box will appear asking you to select a **destination Workspace**. A workspace is a collaborative environment in the Power BI Service. You might have a personal "My Workspace" and several shared workspaces for different teams or projects (e.g., "Sales Analytics - DEV," "Finance - PROD").
    - You select the appropriate workspace and click "Publish."
3. **What Gets Published:** When you publish, two main artifacts are sent to the Power BI Service:
    - **The Report:** A multi-page interactive collection of visuals you designed.
    - **The Dataset:** The underlying data model, including the tables, relationships, DAX measures, and connection information.
4. **Create the Dashboard in Power BI Service:** A common misconception is that you publish a "dashboard" from the Desktop. You actually publish a _report_. The dashboard is then created in the Power BI Service.
    - Navigate to the workspace where you published your report.
    - Open the report.
    - Hover over a visual you want to feature on the dashboard and click the **Pin visual** icon (a thumbtack).
    - You will be prompted to pin it to an **Existing dashboard** or a **New dashboard**.
    - You repeat this process, pinning key visuals from one or more reports to create a single-page, high-level overview. The dashboard tiles then act as links back to the detailed reports.

### 2. What is column profiling?

Column Profiling is a set of data investigation features within the **Power Query Editor**. It allows you to deeply analyze the content and quality of your data on a column-by-column basis _before_ loading it into the data model. This is crucial for data cleaning and understanding.

Key features of Column Profiling include:

- **Column Quality:** Found in the "View" tab of Power Query. It adds a small bar under each column header showing the percentage of rows that are:
    - **Valid:** The data is of the correct data type.
    - **Error:** The data could not be converted to the selected data type (e.g., text "abc" in a number column).
    - **Empty:** The cell is null or empty.
- **Column Distribution:** Also in the "View" tab. It provides a chart showing the distribution of values and gives two key counts:
    - **Distinct:** The number of different values in the column (e.g., in `[Red, Blue, Red, Green]`, there are 3 distinct values).
    - **Unique:** The number of values that appear only once (in the same example, `[Blue, Green]` are unique, so the count is 2).
- **Column Profile (Full Pane):** This gives the most detailed view. When you select a column, it shows:
    - **Value Distribution:** A bar chart showing the frequency of each value.
    - **Column Statistics:** A table with metrics like Count, Error, Empty, Distinct, Unique, Min, Max, Average, Standard Deviation, etc. (depending on the data type).

**Why it's important:** It helps you quickly identify issues like unexpected nulls, data entry errors, outliers, and the cardinality (uniqueness) of columns, which is essential for creating effective relationships in your model.

### 3. How will you join two tables with the help of DAX function?

This is a bit of a trick question. The **primary and most efficient way to "join" tables in Power BI is not with DAX**, but by creating a **relationship** between them in the **Model View**. This relationship allows the Power BI engine to filter and pass context between tables in a highly optimized way.

However, DAX provides functions that can _leverage these relationships_ or _simulate a join_ in a calculation, typically for creating calculated columns or tables.

- `**RELATED()**` **(Most Common):** This function is used in a calculated column on the "many" side of a one-to-many relationship to fetch a value from the "one" side.
    - **Syntax:** `RELATED(<column>)`
    - **Example:** If you have a `Sales` table (many) and a `Products` table (one) related by `ProductID`, you can add a calculated column in the `Sales` table to get the product name: `Product Name = RELATED(Products[ProductName])`.
- `**LOOKUPVALUE()**`**:** This function is like VLOOKUP in Excel. It retrieves a value from a column where one or more other columns have specific values. It **does not require a pre-existing relationship**, but is less performant than `RELATED`.
    - **Syntax:** `LOOKUPVALUE(<result_columnName>, <search_columnName>, <search_value>[, <search_columnName2>, <search_value2>]…)`
    - **Example:** `Product Name = LOOKUPVALUE(Products[ProductName], Products[ProductID], Sales[ProductID])`.
- **Table Functions (**`**NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN**`**,** `**INTERSECT**`**,** `**UNION**`**):** These DAX functions can create a new calculated table by physically joining two tables. This is less common for general visuals and more for specific data modeling scenarios. They are computationally more expensive than using standard relationships.

**Conclusion:** The best practice is to create a relationship in the Model View. Use `RELATED` for calculated columns when a relationship exists. Use `LOOKUPVALUE` only when a relationship is not available or not active.

---

### 4. What is cross filter?

**Cross-filter direction** is a property of a relationship in the Power BI data model. It determines how filters propagate between the two tables in the relationship.

You can set the cross-filter direction in the "Edit relationship" dialog. There are two options:

1. **Single:** This is the default and recommended direction for most one-to-many relationships. The filter propagates from the "one" side of the relationship to the "many" side.
    - **Example:** If you have `DimCustomer` (one) and `FactSales` (many), a "Single" direction means selecting a customer in the `DimCustomer` table will filter the `FactSales` table to show only sales for that customer. However, selecting a specific sale in `FactSales` will **not** filter the `DimCustomer` table.
2. **Both:** The filter propagates in both directions. The "one" side filters the "many" side, AND the "many" side filters the "one" side.
    - **Example (cont.):** With the direction set to "Both," selecting a customer still filters their sales. But now, if you select a product that was sold only once, the `DimCustomer` table will also be filtered to show only the one customer who bought it.

**Caution and Best Practice:** While "Both" can be useful, it should be used with caution. It can create ambiguity in the model (circular filter paths) and can negatively impact performance. The best practice is to keep relationships as "Single" direction and, if you need bi-directional filtering for a specific calculation, use the `CROSSFILTER()` DAX function within that measure instead.

---

### 5. & 7. How will you optimize the DAX code? What will be the checkpoints except these: we will use measures, light customer visuals, star schema, and data type?

This question appears twice. Here is a comprehensive list of DAX optimization techniques beyond the basics you've listed:

1. **Use Variables (VAR):** This is one of the most important optimization techniques.
    - **Why:** A variable stores the result of a DAX expression. If you use that result multiple times within the same measure, the expression is evaluated **only once**. Without variables, it would be re-evaluated each time it's referenced. This also dramatically improves code readability.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```Plain
        // Inefficient
        Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0) * 100
        
        // Efficient and Readable
        Profit Margin =
        VAR TotalProfit = [Total Profit]
        VAR TotalSales = [Total Sales]
        RETURN
            DIVIDE(TotalProfit, TotalSales, 0) * 100
        ```
        
2. **Minimize Context Transitions:** A context transition occurs when a row context is turned into a filter context, which is computationally expensive. This typically happens when you use `CALCULATE` inside an iterator function like `SUMX` or `FILTER`.
    - **Bad:** `SUMX(Sales, CALCULATE(SUM(Products[Price])))`
    - **Better:** Try to pre-calculate values in Power Query or use simpler measures that don't require nested `CALCULATE` inside iterators.
3. **Prefer Simple Filter Arguments in** `**CALCULATE**`**:** The `CALCULATE` function is highly optimized for simple, direct filter arguments (known as sargable predicates).
    - **Efficient:** `CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'Product'[Color] = "Red")`
    - **Inefficient:** `CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER(ALL('Product'), 'Product'[Color] = "Red"))`. The `FILTER` function is an iterator that scans the entire table, which is much slower.
4. **Use** `**DIVIDE()**` **instead of the** `**/**` **operator:** The `DIVIDE()` function is optimized to handle divide-by-zero errors gracefully and is more efficient than writing an `IF` statement to check for a zero denominator.
    - **Bad:** `IF( [Denominator] = 0, BLANK(), [Numerator] / [Denominator] )`
    - **Good:** `DIVIDE( [Numerator], [Denominator] )`
5. **Use** `**SELECTEDVALUE()**` **instead of** `**VALUES()**` **or** `**HASONEVALUE()**`**:** When you need to capture a single selection from a slicer or filter, `SELECTEDVALUE` is more concise, readable, and often more efficient than combining `HASONEVALUE` and `VALUES`.
6. **Avoid Using Entire Tables as Filters:** When filtering, be as specific as possible. Filtering by a single column is much faster than filtering by an entire table.
    - **Bad:** `CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER('Date', 'Date'[Year] = 2023))`
    - **Good:** `CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'Date'[Year] = 2023)` or even better, use the Time Intelligence functions `DATESYTD`, etc.
7. **Use** `**KEEPFILTERS**`**:** When you want to add a new filter within `CALCULATE` without overriding the existing external filter context, use `KEEPFILTERS`. This creates an intersection of filters rather than a replacement.
8. **Leverage Performance Analyzer:** Use the Performance Analyzer pane in Power BI Desktop. It records the time taken by each visual to render and allows you to copy the DAX query generated for that visual. You can then analyze this query in DAX Studio to understand bottlenecks.

### 6. What is the difference between LOOKUPVALUE and RELATED function?

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|`RELATED()`|`LOOKUPVALUE()`|
|**Requirement**|An **active, existing relationship** must be in place between the tables.|**No relationship is required.** It works by matching values.|
|**Context**|Works within a **row context** (e.g., in a calculated column).|Can be used in either a row or filter context.|
|**Direction**|Follows the path of a **many-to-one** relationship. You cannot use it on the "one" side to get a value from the "many" side.|Can look up a value in any table, regardless of direction or relationship.|
|**Performance**|**Very fast and highly optimized.** It uses the pre-built indexes of the relationship in the VertiPaq engine.|**Slower than** `**RELATED**`**.** It has to perform a scan/search of the target column for the matching value.|
|**Use Case**|The **standard and preferred** way to bring a value from a dimension table into a fact table for a calculated column.|Used when a relationship doesn't exist, is inactive, or when dealing with complex many-to-many scenarios where a simple relationship is not possible.|

**Bottom Line:** Always use `RELATED` if a proper relationship exists. It is significantly more performant. Use `LOOKUPVALUE` as a powerful but more costly alternative when relationships are not an option.

---

### 8. What is the difference between row context and filter context?

This is one of the most fundamental and critical concepts in DAX.

**Row Context**

- **Concept:** "The current row." It allows a DAX expression to be aware of the values in all columns of the single row it is currently evaluating. It does not filter other tables.
- **How it's created:**
    1. **Calculated Columns:** When you create a calculated column, the formula is evaluated for each row of the table, one at a time. The row context is that specific row.
    2. **Iterator Functions:** Functions that end in "X" (like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `FILTER`, `ADDCOLUMNS`) create a row context. They iterate over a specified table, row by row, and can perform a calculation for each row.
- **Example:** In a `Sales` table, a calculated column `Line Total = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price]` operates in a row context. For each row, it multiplies the quantity and price _from that same row_.

**Filter Context**

- **Concept:** "The active filters." It is the set of all filters applied to the data model _before_ a measure is calculated.
- **How it's created:**
    1. **Report Visuals:** Slicers, filters on the Filters Pane, clicking on a bar in a chart, or columns/rows in a matrix all create a filter context.
    2. **The** `**CALCULATE**` **function:** `CALCULATE` is the most powerful function in DAX precisely because it can modify the filter context.
- **Example:** A measure `Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Line Total])`. If you put this measure in a card visual and select "2023" in a Year slicer, the slicer creates a filter context (`'Date'[Year] = 2023`). The `Total Sales` measure is then calculated _only for the rows that match this filter_.

**The Bridge (Context Transition):** The `CALCULATE` function can transform a row context into an equivalent filter context. This is a powerful but computationally expensive operation.

---

### 9. What is the difference between ALL and REMOVEFILTERS?

Functionally, when used as a filter modifier inside `CALCULATE`, they do the same thing: they remove filters from a table or column. The difference is in their syntax, readability, and versatility.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|`ALL()`|`REMOVEFILTERS()`|
|**Primary Use**|Can be used as a **table function** (returns a full, unfiltered table) OR as a `**CALCULATE**` **modifier**.|Can **only** be used as a `CALCULATE` modifier. It's syntactic sugar.|
|**Readability**|Less clear. `ALL` can be ambiguous. Does it mean all rows, or remove all filters?|Very clear. Its name explicitly states its purpose: removing filters. This is considered a best practice for clean code.|
|**Versatility**|More versatile. You can use it to return a table for use in other functions, e.g., `COUNTROWS(ALL(Customers))`.|Less versatile, as it only works inside `CALCULATE`.|
|**Example**|`CALCULATE([Sales], ALL(Products))`|`CALCULATE([Sales], REMOVEFILTERS(Products))`|

**Recommendation:**

- When your intent is to **remove filters inside** `**CALCULATE**`, use `REMOVEFILTERS` for better code readability.
- When you need to get an **unfiltered table as an input** for another function (like `SUMX` or `COUNTROWS`), you must use `ALL`.

### 10. & 11. How will you refresh all and remove filter? / How will you refresh a single table in Power BI?

The first question seems to have a typo and likely means "How will you refresh the entire dataset?".

**Refreshing the Entire Dataset ("Refresh All")**

You can refresh the entire dataset to get the latest data from the sources.

- **In Power BI Desktop:**
    - On the **Home** ribbon, click the **Refresh** button. This will re-query all data sources for all tables in your model and load them.
- **In Power BI Service:**
    1. **Manual Refresh:** Go to the workspace, find your dataset, click the ellipsis (...), and select **Refresh now**.
    2. **Scheduled Refresh:** This is the standard automated approach.
        - In the dataset settings, you configure the data source credentials. If the source is on-premise (like a local SQL Server), you must have an **On-premises Data Gateway** installed and configured.
        - You can then set up a schedule to refresh the dataset automatically up to 8 times a day (for Pro license) or 48 times a day (for Premium).

**Refreshing a Single Table**

This is typically done during development within the **Power Query Editor** in Power BI Desktop.

1. Open the Power Query Editor ("Transform data").
2. In the **Queries** pane on the left, find the table (query) you want to refresh.
3. Right-click on the query name and select **Refresh**.
4. Power BI will re-execute the steps for that specific query only, pulling fresh data from its source into the Power Query preview.

**Important Note:** Refreshing a single table in Power Query only updates the _preview_ data. To load that new data into the final data model that your visuals use, you must still click **Close & Apply** in Power Query and/or do a full dataset refresh. The exception to this is **Incremental Refresh** (a Premium feature), which can be configured to intelligently refresh only parts of a specific table in the Power BI Service.

---

### 12. What will be preferred: slicer or filters? Which is good to use?

It's not a question of which is better, but which is appropriate for the situation. They serve different purposes and audiences.

**Slicers**

- **Purpose:** To provide an obvious, on-canvas, interactive way for **end-users** to filter the report page.
- **Visibility:** They are visuals that sit directly on the report canvas.
- **When to Use:**
    - For common, important filters that you expect users to change frequently (e.g., Year, Region, Product Category).
    - When you want to make filtering options highly visible and easy to access.
    - To show the current filtered state clearly (e.g., the selected button in a slicer is highlighted).

**Filters (in the Filters Pane)**

- **Purpose:** To provide more advanced or "behind-the-scenes" filtering, often set by the **report developer**, but can also be used by end-users.
- **Visibility:** They reside in the Filters Pane, which can be collapsed or hidden from end-users.
- **When to Use:**
    - For "lockdown" filters that you don't want the user to change (e.g., filtering out test data or discontinued products).
    - For more complex filtering logic, like "Top N" (e.g., show Top 10 Customers).
    - To filter on a field that is not used in any visual on the page.
    - When you have too many potential filters and don't want to clutter the canvas with slicers.
    - To apply a filter to a single visual, a whole page, or the entire report (Visual-level, Page-level, Report-level filters).

**Conclusion:** Use **Slicers** for primary, user-facing, interactive filtering. Use the **Filters Pane** for developer-set conditions, advanced filtering, and keeping the report canvas clean. A good report often uses a combination of both.

### 13. What is the difference between dashboard and report?

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**Report**|**Dashboard**|
|**Creation**|Created in **Power BI Desktop**.|Created in the **Power BI Service**.|
|**Pages**|Can have **multiple, interactive pages** with deep-dive analysis.|Is a **single canvas/page**.|
|**Data Source**|Based on a **single dataset**.|Can contain visuals (tiles) pinned from **multiple reports** and therefore **multiple datasets**.|
|**Interactivity**|**Highly interactive.** Slicers, cross-filtering (clicking one visual filters others), drill-through, bookmarks.|**Less interactive.** Clicking a tile takes you to the underlying report page. No slicers or cross-filtering between tiles.|
|**Key Features**|Detailed analysis, rich visuals, bookmarks, drill-through.|High-level overview, monitoring, Q&A (ask questions in natural language), data alerts.|
|**Analogy**|A detailed, multi-chapter **book**.|The **cover or table of contents** of the book, providing a summary and entry points.|

### 14. How will you give permission to 50 users in Power BI? How will you do that?

Adding 50 users individually is inefficient and a maintenance nightmare. The correct and scalable approach is to use **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Security Groups** and share a **Power BI App**.

**The Process:**

1. **Step 1: Create an AAD Security Group (Prerequisite).**
    - Work with your IT/Azure administrator to create an AAD Security Group (e.g., "Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Add the 50 users to this single group. This is the crucial step for manageability. Now, you only need to manage the membership of this one group instead of 50 individual permissions.
2. **Step 2: Assign Permissions to the Workspace.**
    - In the Power BI Service, go to the workspace containing your report and dataset.
    - Click the **Access** button in the top right.
    - Enter the name of the AAD Security Group ("Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Assign a role. For consumers, this should be **Viewer**. A viewer can see and interact with content but cannot change it. (Other roles are Contributor, Member, Admin).
3. **Step 3: Publish and Share a Power BI App (Best Practice).**
    - Distributing content via an App provides a much better user experience than sending users directly to a workspace. An App is a polished, curated collection of reports and dashboards.
    - In your workspace, click **Create app**.
    - Give the App a name, description, and logo. In the **Content** tab, select the reports/dashboards you want to include.
    - Go to the **Permissions** tab.
    - Instead of adding individual users, add the **AAD Security Group** ("Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Click **Publish app**. You can then share the link to this App with your 50 users. They will have a clean, branded interface to consume the content.

This method is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain. To add or remove a user's access, you simply update the AAD group membership.

---

### 15. Suppose someone with a contributor role who is not part of your team can view the data and dashboard. If yes, what should be done?

**Yes, someone with a Contributor role can absolutely view the data and dashboard.** In fact, they can do much more than that. A **Contributor** can:

- View, edit, delete, and create content within the workspace (reports, dashboards, datasets).
- Publish reports to the workspace.
- Create and share Apps.

They cannot, however, manage user permissions (that requires a Member or Admin role).

**What should be done? (The Solution)**

The core issue here is a violation of the **Principle of Least Privilege**. Users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their jobs. A user who only needs to _view_ a report should not be a Contributor.

**The Action Plan:**

1. **Identify the User and the Reason:** Determine why this user was given the Contributor role. It may have been a mistake or a temporary elevation of privilege that was never revoked.
2. **Communicate:** Inform the user and their manager that their role is being adjusted to reflect their actual needs, which is to view reports.
3. **Change the Role:**
    - Go to the Power BI workspace.
    - Click the **Access** button.
    - Find the user (or the group they are in).
    - Change their assigned role from **Contributor** to **Viewer**.
4. **Educate the Team:** Use this as a teaching moment to educate the workspace administrators on the differences between Power BI roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer) and the importance of applying the Principle of Least Privilege to protect data integrity and security.

### 16. How will you join 2 tables in Power Query?

Joining tables in Power Query is done using the **Merge Queries** feature. This is the equivalent of a SQL JOIN operation.

**The Steps:**

1. Open the **Power Query Editor** by clicking "Transform data".
2. Select the primary table you want to add columns to (this will be the "left" table in the join).
3. On the **Home** ribbon, in the "Combine" group, click **Merge Queries**. (You can choose "Merge Queries" to add the new columns to your existing table, or "Merge Queries as New" to create a completely new, merged table).
4. The "Merge" dialog box will appear.
    - The top table is your selected "left" table.
    - In the dropdown below it, select the second table you want to join (the "right" table).
    - Click on the **key column(s)** in both tables that will be used to match the rows. The column headers will highlight. Power BI will show you how many rows match at the bottom of the dialog.
5. Select the **Join Kind**. This is the most critical step. The common options are:
    - **Left Outer (all from first, matching from second):** The default and most common. Keeps all rows from the left table and brings in matches from the right.
    - **Inner (only matching rows):** Keeps only the rows that have a match in both tables.
    - **Full Outer (all rows from both):** Keeps all rows from both tables, matching them where possible.
    - **Left Anti (rows only in first):** Keeps only the rows from the left table that have _no_ match in the right table. Useful for finding orphaned records.
6. Click **OK**. A new column will be added to your left table. This column contains `[Table]` objects.
7. Click the **Expand** icon (two arrows pointing away from each other) in the header of this new column.
8. A dialog will appear, allowing you to select which columns from the right table you want to add to your primary table. Uncheck any you don't need and click **OK**.

The columns from the second table are now joined into the first.

---

### 17. If you want to apply the same slicer across multiple pages, how will you achieve that?

You achieve this using the **Sync Slicers** feature.

**The Process:**

1. **Create and format the slicer** on one of the pages (your "source" page).
2. With the slicer visual selected, go to the **View** tab in the Power BI Desktop ribbon.
3. Check the box for the **Sync slicers** pane. This will open a new pane on the right.
4. The Sync slicers pane shows a list of all pages in your report. For each page, there are two checkboxes next to your selected slicer:
    - **Sync (Chain icon):** This controls the _filtering_. If you check this box for a page, any selection made on the slicer will filter the visuals on that page, even if the slicer isn't visible there.
    - **Visible (Eye icon):** This controls the _visibility_ of the slicer visual itself. If you check this box, a copy of the slicer will appear on that page.
5. **Configure as Needed:**
    - To have one master slicer on Page 1 that filters Pages 1, 2, and 3: Keep it visible only on Page 1, but check the "Sync" box for all three pages.
    - To have the exact same slicer appear and be in sync on Pages 1, 2, and 3: Check both the "Sync" and "Visible" boxes for all three pages.

This powerful feature ensures a consistent user experience and saves you from having to manually set filters on every page.

### 18. How will you handle data from different data sources like one is from Google Sheets, another is from SQL Server, and another is from a previous project dataset? What will be the approach to bring them into Power BI Desktop?

Power BI Desktop is designed to connect to multiple, disparate data sources and integrate them into a single model. The approach is to connect to each source individually using the "Get Data" feature.

**The Approach:**

1. **Open Power BI Desktop and go to the "Get Data" menu.**
2. **Connect to SQL Server:**
    - Choose `Get Data > SQL Server`.
    - Enter the Server name and, optionally, the Database name.
    - Choose the **Data Connectivity mode**:
        - **Import:** Pulls a copy of the data into Power BI. Faster performance, but data is static until refreshed.
        - **DirectQuery:** Leaves the data in the SQL Server. Power BI sends live queries. Slower, but data is real-time. (Choose Import unless the dataset is massive or real-time is mandatory).
    - Use the Navigator window to select the specific tables or views you need.
3. **Connect to Google Sheets:**
    - Choose `Get Data > Web`.
    - You need a public link to the Google Sheet. In Google Sheets, go to `File > Share > Publish to the web` and get the link, making sure to publish it as a CSV or Excel file.
    - Paste this URL into Power BI's "Web" connector.
    - _(Alternative/Robust Method)_: A more reliable method is to use a Power Automate flow to periodically save the Google Sheet as an Excel file into a SharePoint or OneDrive folder, and then use Power BI's native `SharePoint folder` or `Excel` connector. This avoids issues with public links.
4. **Connect to a Previous Project Dataset (Power BI Dataset):**
    - Choose `Get Data > Power BI datasets`.
    - A list of all datasets you have access to in the Power BI Service will appear.
    - Select the dataset from the previous project.
    - This will create a **Live Connection** to that published dataset. This means you are connecting to a pre-existing, curated data model. You cannot modify the data transformations or relationships in your new PBIX file; you can only build new report visuals on top of it. This promotes a "single source of truth."

**Integration:**  
Once all three sources are connected, they will appear as separate queries in the Power Query Editor. Here, you can perform any necessary cleaning and transformation. After clicking "Close & Apply," all the tables will be loaded into your data model. You can then create relationships between them in the **Model View**, for example, by linking a `CustomerID` from your SQL Server `Sales` table to the `CustomerID` in the Google Sheets `Customer Info` table.

### 19. What is the difference between galaxy and star schema?

Both are data modeling designs used in data warehousing and business intelligence. The Star Schema is the foundation.

**Star Schema**

- **Structure:** Consists of one central **Fact Table** surrounded by several **Dimension Tables**.
- **Fact Table:** Contains quantitative business data (the "facts" or measures), like `SalesAmount`, `Quantity`, `Cost`. It also contains foreign keys to the dimension tables.
- **Dimension Tables:** Contain descriptive attributes (the "dimensions"), like `Product Name`, `Customer City`, `Date`. They have a primary key that is referenced by the fact table.
- **Analogy:** It looks like a star, with the fact table at the center and the dimension tables as the points of the star.
- **Characteristics:** Simple, easy to understand, and highly optimized for the query performance of BI tools like Power BI. All relationships are one-to-many from the dimension to the fact table.

**Galaxy Schema (also called Fact Constellation Schema)**

- **Structure:** A more complex design that consists of **multiple Fact Tables** that share one or more **common Dimension Tables**.
- **Analogy:** It's like a collection of stars (a "galaxy"), where the shared dimensions act as the link between different fact tables (the star systems).
- **Example:** You might have a `Sales` fact table and a `Shipping` fact table. Both of these fact tables could be linked to the same `DimProduct`, `DimDate`, and `DimStore` dimension tables. This allows you to analyze sales and shipping metrics together by product, date, or store.
- **Use Case:** Used when you want to model and analyze multiple, related business processes in a single data model.

**In Summary:** A Star Schema has one fact table. A Galaxy Schema has two or more fact tables that share dimensions.

### 20. What is a composite model?

A **Composite Model** is a feature in Power BI that allows a single report to seamlessly combine data from different **Data Connectivity modes**. Specifically, it lets you combine:

- **DirectQuery** sources (e.g., a live connection to a massive SQL Data Warehouse).
- **Import** sources (e.g., an imported Excel file with budget data).
- **Power BI datasets** (Live Connection).

**Why is it important?**

Before composite models, a Power BI report was limited to either entirely Import mode or a single DirectQuery source. You couldn't mix them.

**Key Capabilities of a Composite Model:**

1. **Mix and Match:** You can have a DirectQuery connection to your main enterprise data warehouse for real-time fact data, and also _import_ a smaller Excel/CSV file (like sales targets or product groupings) and create relationships between the two.
2. **Best of Both Worlds:** This gives you the performance and flexibility of Import mode for smaller dimension tables, combined with the scalability and real-time nature of DirectQuery for huge fact tables.
3. **Many-to-Many Relationships:** Composite models were the feature that enabled the robust implementation of many-to-many relationships in Power BI.
4. **Enhanced Performance:** You can change the storage mode of individual tables. For example, a dimension table from a DirectQuery source can be set to "Dual" mode, meaning it can act as either Import or DirectQuery, which Power BI intelligently chooses to optimize query performance.

A composite model is an advanced data modeling technique that provides ultimate flexibility for complex enterprise-level reporting scenarios.

### 21. What filter have you used?

This is an open-ended question, so the best way to answer is to demonstrate knowledge of the _types_ of filters available in Power BI and when you would use each.

"In my projects, I use a combination of filters depending on the goal. My filtering strategy typically includes:"

1. **User-Facing Interactive Filters (Slicers):**
    - "For the primary dimensions that users need to interact with, like **Date**, **Region**, or **Product Category**, I always use **Slicers** directly on the report canvas. This provides an intuitive and obvious way for users to explore the data."
2. **Backend/Developer Filters (Filters Pane):**
    - **Page-Level Filters:** "If an entire report page is dedicated to a specific segment, like 'Executive Overview' or a single country, I apply a **Page-Level Filter** in the Filters Pane. This ensures all visuals on that page are correctly filtered without cluttering the canvas."
    - **Report-Level Filters:** "I use **Report-Level Filters** for conditions that must apply to the entire report, such as filtering out test data, excluding records before a certain go-live date, or focusing the entire report on the current fiscal year."
    - **Visual-Level Filters:** "For specific charts, I use **Visual-Level Filters**. A common example is creating a 'Top 10 Products' bar chart by applying a 'Top N' filter to just that one visual."
3. **DAX-based Filters (in Measures):**
    - "Inside my DAX measures, I extensively use the `**CALCULATE**` function to apply complex filter logic that can't be achieved with simple slicers. For example, to create a 'Year-over-Year Sales Growth' measure, I use `CALCULATE` combined with time intelligence functions like `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` to modify the date filter context."
4. **Security Filters (Row-Level Security):**
    - "For reports containing sensitive data, I implement **Row-Level Security (RLS)**. I create roles (e.g., 'Regional Manager - North') and use DAX rules to filter the data so that when a user from that role logs in, they automatically see only the data for their specific region. This is the most secure way to manage data access."

By explaining the different types and their use cases, you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how to control the data presented to the user.

### 22. What is the difference between import and DirectQuery connectivity mode? Which one is better?

This is a fundamental choice when connecting to a data source. There is no single "better" one; the best choice depends entirely on the project's requirements for performance, data size, and data freshness.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**Import Mode**|**DirectQuery Mode**|
|**How it Works**|A **copy** of the data is loaded, compressed, and stored in-memory in the Power BI file (PBIX) using the VertiPaq engine.|**No data is copied.** Power BI stores only the metadata (table and column names). Every visual interaction sends a live query to the source database.|
|**Performance**|**Very Fast.** Queries are resolved by the highly optimized in-memory VertiPaq engine.|**Variable/Slower.** Performance is entirely dependent on the speed and optimization of the underlying source database. Poorly written DAX can translate to slow SQL.|
|**Data Freshness**|Data is **static** and only as fresh as the last refresh. Requires a manual or scheduled refresh to be updated.|Data is **near real-time.** Every visual shows the latest data from the source.|
|**Data Size**|**Limited.** The dataset size is constrained by memory and license type (e.g., 1 GB for Pro, up to 400 GB for Premium).|**Virtually unlimited.** Can handle datasets that are terabytes in size, as the data remains in the source system.|
|**DAX & Power Query**|**Full functionality.** All M (Power Query) and DAX functions are supported.|**Limited functionality.** Some transformations and DAX functions are not supported because they cannot be translated into a native query for the source database.|
|**Source Load**|Puts a heavy load on the source **only during refresh**.|Puts a **constant, interactive load** on the source database. A popular report can generate thousands of queries.|

**Which one is better? The Verdict:**

- **Use Import Mode (Default & Preferred):**
    - When performance is the top priority.
    - When the dataset size is manageable (from a few MB up to a few GB).
    - When near real-time data is not a strict requirement (daily or hourly refreshes are acceptable).
    - When you need the full power of Power Query and DAX.
    - **This covers 80-90% of all Power BI use cases.**
- **Use DirectQuery Mode:**
    - When the source dataset is **too large to import** into memory (e.g., many billions of rows).
    - When there is a strict business requirement for **real-time or near real-time data**.
    - When data residency policies prevent data from being copied out of the source system.
- **Use a Composite Model (The Hybrid Solution):**
    - For the best of both worlds, use a composite model. Keep massive fact tables in DirectQuery and import smaller, related dimension tables to get the best possible performance and flexibility.
