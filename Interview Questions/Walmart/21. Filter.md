### 21. What filter have you used?

This is an open-ended question, so the best way to answer is to demonstrate knowledge of the _types_ of filters available in Power BI and when you would use each.

"In my projects, I use a combination of filters depending on the goal. My filtering strategy typically includes:"

1. **User-Facing Interactive Filters (Slicers):**
    - "For the primary dimensions that users need to interact with, like **Date**, **Region**, or **Product Category**, I always use **Slicers** directly on the report canvas. This provides an intuitive and obvious way for users to explore the data."
2. **Backend/Developer Filters (Filters Pane):**
    - **Page-Level Filters:** "If an entire report page is dedicated to a specific segment, like 'Executive Overview' or a single country, I apply a **Page-Level Filter** in the Filters Pane. This ensures all visuals on that page are correctly filtered without cluttering the canvas."
    - **Report-Level Filters:** "I use **Report-Level Filters** for conditions that must apply to the entire report, such as filtering out test data, excluding records before a certain go-live date, or focusing the entire report on the current fiscal year."
    - **Visual-Level Filters:** "For specific charts, I use **Visual-Level Filters**. A common example is creating a 'Top 10 Products' bar chart by applying a 'Top N' filter to just that one visual."
3. **DAX-based Filters (in Measures):**
    - "Inside my DAX measures, I extensively use the `**CALCULATE**` function to apply complex filter logic that can't be achieved with simple slicers. For example, to create a 'Year-over-Year Sales Growth' measure, I use `CALCULATE` combined with time intelligence functions like `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` to modify the date filter context."
4. **Security Filters (Row-Level Security):**
    - "For reports containing sensitive data, I implement **Row-Level Security (RLS)**. I create roles (e.g., 'Regional Manager - North') and use DAX rules to filter the data so that when a user from that role logs in, they automatically see only the data for their specific region. This is the most secure way to manage data access."

By explaining the different types and their use cases, you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how to control the data presented to the user.
