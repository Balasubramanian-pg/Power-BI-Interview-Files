### 12. What will be preferred: slicer or filters? Which is good to use?

It's not a question of which is better, but which is appropriate for the situation. They serve different purposes and audiences.

**Slicers**

- **Purpose:** To provide an obvious, on-canvas, interactive way for **end-users** to filter the report page.
- **Visibility:** They are visuals that sit directly on the report canvas.
- **When to Use:**
    - For common, important filters that you expect users to change frequently (e.g., Year, Region, Product Category).
    - When you want to make filtering options highly visible and easy to access.
    - To show the current filtered state clearly (e.g., the selected button in a slicer is highlighted).

**Filters (in the Filters Pane)**

- **Purpose:** To provide more advanced or "behind-the-scenes" filtering, often set by the **report developer**, but can also be used by end-users.
- **Visibility:** They reside in the Filters Pane, which can be collapsed or hidden from end-users.
- **When to Use:**
    - For "lockdown" filters that you don't want the user to change (e.g., filtering out test data or discontinued products).
    - For more complex filtering logic, like "Top N" (e.g., show Top 10 Customers).
    - To filter on a field that is not used in any visual on the page.
    - When you have too many potential filters and don't want to clutter the canvas with slicers.
    - To apply a filter to a single visual, a whole page, or the entire report (Visual-level, Page-level, Report-level filters).

**Conclusion:** Use **Slicers** for primary, user-facing, interactive filtering. Use the **Filters Pane** for developer-set conditions, advanced filtering, and keeping the report canvas clean. A good report often uses a combination of both.
