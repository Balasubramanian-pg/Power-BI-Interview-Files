### 20. What is a composite model?

A **Composite Model** is a feature in Power BI that allows a single report to seamlessly combine data from different **Data Connectivity modes**. Specifically, it lets you combine:

- **DirectQuery** sources (e.g., a live connection to a massive SQL Data Warehouse).
- **Import** sources (e.g., an imported Excel file with budget data).
- **Power BI datasets** (Live Connection).

**Why is it important?**

Before composite models, a Power BI report was limited to either entirely Import mode or a single DirectQuery source. You couldn't mix them.

**Key Capabilities of a Composite Model:**

1. **Mix and Match:** You can have a DirectQuery connection to your main enterprise data warehouse for real-time fact data, and also _import_ a smaller Excel/CSV file (like sales targets or product groupings) and create relationships between the two.
2. **Best of Both Worlds:** This gives you the performance and flexibility of Import mode for smaller dimension tables, combined with the scalability and real-time nature of DirectQuery for huge fact tables.
3. **Many-to-Many Relationships:** Composite models were the feature that enabled the robust implementation of many-to-many relationships in Power BI.
4. **Enhanced Performance:** You can change the storage mode of individual tables. For example, a dimension table from a DirectQuery source can be set to "Dual" mode, meaning it can act as either Import or DirectQuery, which Power BI intelligently chooses to optimize query performance.

A composite model is an advanced data modeling technique that provides ultimate flexibility for complex enterprise-level reporting scenarios.
