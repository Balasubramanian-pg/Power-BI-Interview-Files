### 10. & 11. How will you refresh all and remove filter? / How will you refresh a single table in Power BI?

The first question seems to have a typo and likely means "How will you refresh the entire dataset?".

**Refreshing the Entire Dataset ("Refresh All")**

You can refresh the entire dataset to get the latest data from the sources.

- **In Power BI Desktop:**
    - On the **Home** ribbon, click the **Refresh** button. This will re-query all data sources for all tables in your model and load them.
- **In Power BI Service:**
    1. **Manual Refresh:** Go to the workspace, find your dataset, click the ellipsis (...), and select **Refresh now**.
    2. **Scheduled Refresh:** This is the standard automated approach.
        - In the dataset settings, you configure the data source credentials. If the source is on-premise (like a local SQL Server), you must have an **On-premises Data Gateway** installed and configured.
        - You can then set up a schedule to refresh the dataset automatically up to 8 times a day (for Pro license) or 48 times a day (for Premium).

**Refreshing a Single Table**

This is typically done during development within the **Power Query Editor** in Power BI Desktop.

1. Open the Power Query Editor ("Transform data").
2. In the **Queries** pane on the left, find the table (query) you want to refresh.
3. Right-click on the query name and select **Refresh**.
4. Power BI will re-execute the steps for that specific query only, pulling fresh data from its source into the Power Query preview.

**Important Note:** Refreshing a single table in Power Query only updates the _preview_ data. To load that new data into the final data model that your visuals use, you must still click **Close & Apply** in Power Query and/or do a full dataset refresh. The exception to this is **Incremental Refresh** (a Premium feature), which can be configured to intelligently refresh only parts of a specific table in the Power BI Service.
