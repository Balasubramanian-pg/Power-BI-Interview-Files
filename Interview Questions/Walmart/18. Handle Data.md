### 18. How will you handle data from different data sources like one is from Google Sheets, another is from SQL Server, and another is from a previous project dataset? What will be the approach to bring them into Power BI Desktop?

Power BI Desktop is designed to connect to multiple, disparate data sources and integrate them into a single model. The approach is to connect to each source individually using the "Get Data" feature.

**The Approach:**

1. **Open Power BI Desktop and go to the "Get Data" menu.**
2. **Connect to SQL Server:**
    - Choose `Get Data > SQL Server`.
    - Enter the Server name and, optionally, the Database name.
    - Choose the **Data Connectivity mode**:
        - **Import:** Pulls a copy of the data into Power BI. Faster performance, but data is static until refreshed.
        - **DirectQuery:** Leaves the data in the SQL Server. Power BI sends live queries. Slower, but data is real-time. (Choose Import unless the dataset is massive or real-time is mandatory).
    - Use the Navigator window to select the specific tables or views you need.
3. **Connect to Google Sheets:**
    - Choose `Get Data > Web`.
    - You need a public link to the Google Sheet. In Google Sheets, go to `File > Share > Publish to the web` and get the link, making sure to publish it as a CSV or Excel file.
    - Paste this URL into Power BI's "Web" connector.
    - _(Alternative/Robust Method)_: A more reliable method is to use a Power Automate flow to periodically save the Google Sheet as an Excel file into a SharePoint or OneDrive folder, and then use Power BI's native `SharePoint folder` or `Excel` connector. This avoids issues with public links.
4. **Connect to a Previous Project Dataset (Power BI Dataset):**
    - Choose `Get Data > Power BI datasets`.
    - A list of all datasets you have access to in the Power BI Service will appear.
    - Select the dataset from the previous project.
    - This will create a **Live Connection** to that published dataset. This means you are connecting to a pre-existing, curated data model. You cannot modify the data transformations or relationships in your new PBIX file; you can only build new report visuals on top of it. This promotes a "single source of truth."

**Integration:**  
Once all three sources are connected, they will appear as separate queries in the Power Query Editor. Here, you can perform any necessary cleaning and transformation. After clicking "Close & Apply," all the tables will be loaded into your data model. You can then create relationships between them in the **Model View**, for example, by linking a `CustomerID` from your SQL Server `Sales` table to the `CustomerID` in the Google Sheets `Customer Info` table.
