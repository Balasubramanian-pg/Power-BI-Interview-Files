### 4. What is cross filter?

**Cross-filter direction** is a property of a relationship in the Power BI data model. It determines how filters propagate between the two tables in the relationship.

You can set the cross-filter direction in the "Edit relationship" dialog. There are two options:

1. **Single:** This is the default and recommended direction for most one-to-many relationships. The filter propagates from the "one" side of the relationship to the "many" side.
    - **Example:** If you have `DimCustomer` (one) and `FactSales` (many), a "Single" direction means selecting a customer in the `DimCustomer` table will filter the `FactSales` table to show only sales for that customer. However, selecting a specific sale in `FactSales` will **not** filter the `DimCustomer` table.
2. **Both:** The filter propagates in both directions. The "one" side filters the "many" side, AND the "many" side filters the "one" side.
    - **Example (cont.):** With the direction set to "Both," selecting a customer still filters their sales. But now, if you select a product that was sold only once, the `DimCustomer` table will also be filtered to show only the one customer who bought it.

**Caution and Best Practice:** While "Both" can be useful, it should be used with caution. It can create ambiguity in the model (circular filter paths) and can negatively impact performance. The best practice is to keep relationships as "Single" direction and, if you need bi-directional filtering for a specific calculation, use the `CROSSFILTER()` DAX function within that measure instead.
