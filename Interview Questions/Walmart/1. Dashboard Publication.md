 ### 1. How will you publish the dashboard?

Publishing in Power BI is a multi-step process that involves moving your work from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

1. **Develop in Power BI Desktop:** First, you create your report in Power BI Desktop. This involves connecting to data sources, transforming data in Power Query, creating the data model (relationships, measures), and designing the report visuals on various pages.
2. **Publish from Desktop:**
    - In Power BI Desktop, on the **Home** ribbon, you click the **Publish** button.
    - You will be prompted to sign in to your Power BI Service account (e.g., `yourname@yourcompany.com`).
    - After signing in, a dialog box will appear asking you to select a **destination Workspace**. A workspace is a collaborative environment in the Power BI Service. You might have a personal "My Workspace" and several shared workspaces for different teams or projects (e.g., "Sales Analytics - DEV," "Finance - PROD").
    - You select the appropriate workspace and click "Publish."
3. **What Gets Published:** When you publish, two main artifacts are sent to the Power BI Service:
    - **The Report:** A multi-page interactive collection of visuals you designed.
    - **The Dataset:** The underlying data model, including the tables, relationships, DAX measures, and connection information.
4. **Create the Dashboard in Power BI Service:** A common misconception is that you publish a "dashboard" from the Desktop. You actually publish a _report_. The dashboard is then created in the Power BI Service.
    - Navigate to the workspace where you published your report.
    - Open the report.
    - Hover over a visual you want to feature on the dashboard and click the **Pin visual** icon (a thumbtack).
    - You will be prompted to pin it to an **Existing dashboard** or a **New dashboard**.
    - You repeat this process, pinning key visuals from one or more reports to create a single-page, high-level overview. The dashboard tiles then act as links back to the detailed reports.
