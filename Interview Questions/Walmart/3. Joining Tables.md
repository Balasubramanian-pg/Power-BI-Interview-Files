### 3. How will you join two tables with the help of DAX function?

This is a bit of a trick question. The **primary and most efficient way to "join" tables in Power BI is not with DAX**, but by creating a **relationship** between them in the **Model View**. This relationship allows the Power BI engine to filter and pass context between tables in a highly optimized way.

However, DAX provides functions that can _leverage these relationships_ or _simulate a join_ in a calculation, typically for creating calculated columns or tables.

- `**RELATED()**` **(Most Common):** This function is used in a calculated column on the "many" side of a one-to-many relationship to fetch a value from the "one" side.
    - **Syntax:** `RELATED(<column>)`
    - **Example:** If you have a `Sales` table (many) and a `Products` table (one) related by `ProductID`, you can add a calculated column in the `Sales` table to get the product name: `Product Name = RELATED(Products[ProductName])`.
- `**LOOKUPVALUE()**`**:** This function is like VLOOKUP in Excel. It retrieves a value from a column where one or more other columns have specific values. It **does not require a pre-existing relationship**, but is less performant than `RELATED`.
    - **Syntax:** `LOOKUPVALUE(<result_columnName>, <search_columnName>, <search_value>[, <search_columnName2>, <search_value2>]â€¦)`
    - **Example:** `Product Name = LOOKUPVALUE(Products[ProductName], Products[ProductID], Sales[ProductID])`.
- **Table Functions (**`**NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN**`**,** `**INTERSECT**`**,** `**UNION**`**):** These DAX functions can create a new calculated table by physically joining two tables. This is less common for general visuals and more for specific data modeling scenarios. They are computationally more expensive than using standard relationships.

**Conclusion:** The best practice is to create a relationship in the Model View. Use `RELATED` for calculated columns when a relationship exists. Use `LOOKUPVALUE` only when a relationship is not available or not active.
