### 8. What is the difference between row context and filter context?

This is one of the most fundamental and critical concepts in DAX.

**Row Context**

- **Concept:** "The current row." It allows a DAX expression to be aware of the values in all columns of the single row it is currently evaluating. It does not filter other tables.
- **How it's created:**
    1. **Calculated Columns:** When you create a calculated column, the formula is evaluated for each row of the table, one at a time. The row context is that specific row.
    2. **Iterator Functions:** Functions that end in "X" (like `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `FILTER`, `ADDCOLUMNS`) create a row context. They iterate over a specified table, row by row, and can perform a calculation for each row.
- **Example:** In a `Sales` table, a calculated column `Line Total = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price]` operates in a row context. For each row, it multiplies the quantity and price _from that same row_.

**Filter Context**

- **Concept:** "The active filters." It is the set of all filters applied to the data model _before_ a measure is calculated.
- **How it's created:**
    1. **Report Visuals:** Slicers, filters on the Filters Pane, clicking on a bar in a chart, or columns/rows in a matrix all create a filter context.
    2. **The** `**CALCULATE**` **function:** `CALCULATE` is the most powerful function in DAX precisely because it can modify the filter context.
- **Example:** A measure `Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Line Total])`. If you put this measure in a card visual and select "2023" in a Year slicer, the slicer creates a filter context (`'Date'[Year] = 2023`). The `Total Sales` measure is then calculated _only for the rows that match this filter_.

**The Bridge (Context Transition):** The `CALCULATE` function can transform a row context into an equivalent filter context. This is a powerful but computationally expensive operation.
