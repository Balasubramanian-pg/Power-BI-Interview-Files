### 19. What is the difference between galaxy and star schema?

Both are data modeling designs used in data warehousing and business intelligence. The Star Schema is the foundation.

**Star Schema**

- **Structure:** Consists of one central **Fact Table** surrounded by several **Dimension Tables**.
- **Fact Table:** Contains quantitative business data (the "facts" or measures), like `SalesAmount`, `Quantity`, `Cost`. It also contains foreign keys to the dimension tables.
- **Dimension Tables:** Contain descriptive attributes (the "dimensions"), like `Product Name`, `Customer City`, `Date`. They have a primary key that is referenced by the fact table.
- **Analogy:** It looks like a star, with the fact table at the center and the dimension tables as the points of the star.
- **Characteristics:** Simple, easy to understand, and highly optimized for the query performance of BI tools like Power BI. All relationships are one-to-many from the dimension to the fact table.

**Galaxy Schema (also called Fact Constellation Schema)**

- **Structure:** A more complex design that consists of **multiple Fact Tables** that share one or more **common Dimension Tables**.
- **Analogy:** It's like a collection of stars (a "galaxy"), where the shared dimensions act as the link between different fact tables (the star systems).
- **Example:** You might have a `Sales` fact table and a `Shipping` fact table. Both of these fact tables could be linked to the same `DimProduct`, `DimDate`, and `DimStore` dimension tables. This allows you to analyze sales and shipping metrics together by product, date, or store.
- **Use Case:** Used when you want to model and analyze multiple, related business processes in a single data model.

**In Summary:** A Star Schema has one fact table. A Galaxy Schema has two or more fact tables that share dimensions.
