### 14. How will you give permission to 50 users in Power BI? How will you do that?

Adding 50 users individually is inefficient and a maintenance nightmare. The correct and scalable approach is to use **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Security Groups** and share a **Power BI App**.

**The Process:**

1. **Step 1: Create an AAD Security Group (Prerequisite).**
    - Work with your IT/Azure administrator to create an AAD Security Group (e.g., "Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Add the 50 users to this single group. This is the crucial step for manageability. Now, you only need to manage the membership of this one group instead of 50 individual permissions.
2. **Step 2: Assign Permissions to the Workspace.**
    - In the Power BI Service, go to the workspace containing your report and dataset.
    - Click the **Access** button in the top right.
    - Enter the name of the AAD Security Group ("Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Assign a role. For consumers, this should be **Viewer**. A viewer can see and interact with content but cannot change it. (Other roles are Contributor, Member, Admin).
3. **Step 3: Publish and Share a Power BI App (Best Practice).**
    - Distributing content via an App provides a much better user experience than sending users directly to a workspace. An App is a polished, curated collection of reports and dashboards.
    - In your workspace, click **Create app**.
    - Give the App a name, description, and logo. In the **Content** tab, select the reports/dashboards you want to include.
    - Go to the **Permissions** tab.
    - Instead of adding individual users, add the **AAD Security Group** ("Sales Team - Power BI Viewers").
    - Click **Publish app**. You can then share the link to this App with your 50 users. They will have a clean, branded interface to consume the content.

This method is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain. To add or remove a user's access, you simply update the AAD group membership.
