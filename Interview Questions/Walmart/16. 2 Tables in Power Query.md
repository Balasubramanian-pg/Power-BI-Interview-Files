### 16. How will you join 2 tables in Power Query?

Joining tables in Power Query is done using the **Merge Queries** feature. This is the equivalent of a SQL JOIN operation.

**The Steps:**

1. Open the **Power Query Editor** by clicking "Transform data".
2. Select the primary table you want to add columns to (this will be the "left" table in the join).
3. On the **Home** ribbon, in the "Combine" group, click **Merge Queries**. (You can choose "Merge Queries" to add the new columns to your existing table, or "Merge Queries as New" to create a completely new, merged table).
4. The "Merge" dialog box will appear.
    - The top table is your selected "left" table.
    - In the dropdown below it, select the second table you want to join (the "right" table).
    - Click on the **key column(s)** in both tables that will be used to match the rows. The column headers will highlight. Power BI will show you how many rows match at the bottom of the dialog.
5. Select the **Join Kind**. This is the most critical step. The common options are:
    - **Left Outer (all from first, matching from second):** The default and most common. Keeps all rows from the left table and brings in matches from the right.
    - **Inner (only matching rows):** Keeps only the rows that have a match in both tables.
    - **Full Outer (all rows from both):** Keeps all rows from both tables, matching them where possible.
    - **Left Anti (rows only in first):** Keeps only the rows from the left table that have _no_ match in the right table. Useful for finding orphaned records.
6. Click **OK**. A new column will be added to your left table. This column contains `[Table]` objects.
7. Click the **Expand** icon (two arrows pointing away from each other) in the header of this new column.
8. A dialog will appear, allowing you to select which columns from the right table you want to add to your primary table. Uncheck any you don't need and click **OK**.

The columns from the second table are now joined into the first.
