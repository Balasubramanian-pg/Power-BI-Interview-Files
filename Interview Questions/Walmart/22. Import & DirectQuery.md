### 22. What is the difference between import and DirectQuery connectivity mode? Which one is better?

This is a fundamental choice when connecting to a data source. There is no single "better" one; the best choice depends entirely on the project's requirements for performance, data size, and data freshness.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**Import Mode**|**DirectQuery Mode**|
|**How it Works**|A **copy** of the data is loaded, compressed, and stored in-memory in the Power BI file (PBIX) using the VertiPaq engine.|**No data is copied.** Power BI stores only the metadata (table and column names). Every visual interaction sends a live query to the source database.|
|**Performance**|**Very Fast.** Queries are resolved by the highly optimized in-memory VertiPaq engine.|**Variable/Slower.** Performance is entirely dependent on the speed and optimization of the underlying source database. Poorly written DAX can translate to slow SQL.|
|**Data Freshness**|Data is **static** and only as fresh as the last refresh. Requires a manual or scheduled refresh to be updated.|Data is **near real-time.** Every visual shows the latest data from the source.|
|**Data Size**|**Limited.** The dataset size is constrained by memory and license type (e.g., 1 GB for Pro, up to 400 GB for Premium).|**Virtually unlimited.** Can handle datasets that are terabytes in size, as the data remains in the source system.|
|**DAX & Power Query**|**Full functionality.** All M (Power Query) and DAX functions are supported.|**Limited functionality.** Some transformations and DAX functions are not supported because they cannot be translated into a native query for the source database.|
|**Source Load**|Puts a heavy load on the source **only during refresh**.|Puts a **constant, interactive load** on the source database. A popular report can generate thousands of queries.|

**Which one is better? The Verdict:**

- **Use Import Mode (Default & Preferred):**
    - When performance is the top priority.
    - When the dataset size is manageable (from a few MB up to a few GB).
    - When near real-time data is not a strict requirement (daily or hourly refreshes are acceptable).
    - When you need the full power of Power Query and DAX.
    - **This covers 80-90% of all Power BI use cases.**
- **Use DirectQuery Mode:**
    - When the source dataset is **too large to import** into memory (e.g., many billions of rows).
    - When there is a strict business requirement for **real-time or near real-time data**.
    - When data residency policies prevent data from being copied out of the source system.
- **Use a Composite Model (The Hybrid Solution):**
    - For the best of both worlds, use a composite model. Keep massive fact tables in DirectQuery and import smaller, related dimension tables to get the best possible performance and flexibility.
