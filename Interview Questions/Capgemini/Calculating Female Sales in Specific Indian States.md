# **Calculating Female Sales in Specific Indian States**  

## **Problem Statement**  

**Task**:  
Create a DAX measure to calculate total sales from female customers in **Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat** for a WMart India dataset.  

**Data Structure**:  

| Column   | Type       |  
|----------|----------------|  
| Customer | Text         |  
| Gender   | Text (M/F)   |  
| City     | Text         |  
| State    | Text         |  
| Amount   | Currency     |  

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem tests your ability to filter and aggregate data using DAX, specifically with `CALCULATE` and multi-value comparisons.

## **Optimal DAX Solution**  

### **1. Final Measure Code**  
```dax  
Female Sales Selected States =  
CALCULATE(  
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),  
    Sales[Gender] = "F",  
    Sales[State] IN {"Karnataka", "Maharashtra", "Gujarat"}  
)  
```

### **2. Key Components Explained**  

| **Function/Component** | **Purpose**                          | **Why It's Used**                          |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| `CALCULATE()`           | Modifies filter context              | Core function for conditional sums         |  
| `SUM(Sales[Amount])`    | Aggregates sales values              | Base calculation                           |  
| `Sales[Gender] = "F"`   | Filter condition                    | Isolates female customers                  |  
| `IN {}` operator        | Multi-value comparison               | Cleaner than multiple OR conditions        |  

> [!TIP]  
> The `IN` operator is concise and efficient for filtering multiple values.

### **3. Alternative Implementations**  

**Option A (Using `FILTER`)**  
```dax  
Female Sales Selected States =  
CALCULATE(  
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),  
    FILTER(  
        Sales,  
        Sales[Gender] = "F" &&  
        Sales[State] IN {"Karnataka", "Maharashtra", "Gujarat"}  
    )  
)  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
> Use `FILTER` for more complex filtering logic or when combining multiple conditions.  

**Option B (Using Variables)**  
```dax  
Female Sales Selected States =  
VAR TargetStates = {"Karnataka", "Maharashtra", "Gujarat"}  
RETURN  
    CALCULATE(  
        SUM(Sales[Amount]),  
        Sales[Gender] = "F",  
        Sales[State] IN TargetStates  
    )  
```  

> [!TIP]  
> Variables improve readability and reusability, especially for repeated values.

### **Performance Considerations**  

1. **Filter Order Matters**  
   - Apply gender filter first (typically higher selectivity).  
   - Then apply the state filter.  

2. **Avoid Nested `FILTERs`**  
   - The simplified `CALCULATE` with direct filters is more efficient than wrapping in `FILTER()` for simple conditions.  

3. **Consider Data Model**  
   - If State/Gender are in dimension tables, use relationships instead.  
   - Implement row-level security if needed.  

> [!WARNING]  
> Poor filter order or unnecessary nesting can degrade performance, especially on large datasets.  

---

### **Expected Output**  

For the sample data:  
- **Total Female Sales (All States)**: ₹3,500  
- **Female Sales (Target States)**: ₹2,100  
  *(Assuming 60% of female sales come from the 3 target states)*

### **Why This Solution Works for Interviews**  

**Demonstrates Core DAX Skills**  
- `CALCULATE` mastery  
- Filter context manipulation  

**Shows Optimization Awareness**  
- Clean syntax vs. verbose alternatives  
- Performance considerations  

**Handles Real-World Requirements**  
- Geographic segmentation  
- Demographic filtering  

> [!TIP]  
> Always verify your measure with a pivot table or card visual to ensure accuracy.
