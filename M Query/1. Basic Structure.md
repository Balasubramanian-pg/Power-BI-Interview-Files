>M is the functional, case-sensitive language behind Power Query. It's used for data extraction, transformation, and mashup.

#### **1. The Basic Structure: `let ... in`**

Every M query is a `let` expression. It's a series of steps (variables) where each step can build upon the previous one.

```m
let
    // Step 1: Give it a name, define what it does.
    Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("C:\Data\Sales.csv"), [Delimiter=","]),

    // Step 2: This step uses the result of the 'Source' step.
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),

    // Step 3: This step uses the result of the 'Promoted Headers' step.
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Promoted Headers",{{"Date", type date}, {"Amount", Currency.Type}})

// The 'in' statement defines the final output of the query.
in
    #"Changed Type"
```

**Pro Tip:** Use the UI to generate the basic code, then go into the Advanced Editor to refine it. Name your steps clearly for readability (e.g., `FilteredInactiveProducts` instead of `#"Filtered Rows1"`).
