### **Key Interview Topics to Discuss**
- **Performance Tuning**: Aggregations, variables, avoiding context transition.
- **Advanced Relationships**: Bidirectional vs. single-direction, M2M, virtual.
- **DAX Engine**: Storage Engine vs. Formula Engine, VertiPaq optimizations.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Explain how youâ€™ve used these patterns in production.
- **Limitations**: When DAX isnâ€™t enough (e.g., ETL, Python/R integration).

This list pushes into **expert territory**â€”focus on understanding the "why" behind each pattern, not just the syntax. Pair these with mock interviews and real-world projects to solidify your expertise. ðŸš€
