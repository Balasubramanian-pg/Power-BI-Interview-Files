Got it! For **Big 4 interviews (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG)**, the focus is less on hyper-advanced DAX and more on **practical, business-oriented scenarios**, clean data modeling, and clear explanations. Below are **20 essential DAX measures** tailored to common Big 4 case studies and interview questions, with a focus on **financial analysis, KPI tracking, and data validation**:

---

### **Core Financial Metrics**
1. **Gross Profit**  
   ```DAX
   Gross Profit = SUM(Sales[Revenue]) - SUM(Sales[COGS])
   ```  
   *Basic but critical for P&L analysis. Know how to handle currency/units.*

2. **Profit Margin (%)**  
   ```DAX
   Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 0)
   ```  
   *Always use `DIVIDE` to avoid division-by-zero errors.*

3. **Budget vs. Actual Variance**  
   ```DAX
   Variance = [Actual Sales] - [Budget Sales]
   Variance % = DIVIDE([Variance], [Budget Sales])
   ```  
   *Common in FP&A scenarios. Be ready to explain absolute vs. relative variance.*

---

### **Time Intelligence (Key for Big 4)**
4. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth**  
   ```DAX
   Sales YoY Growth = 
   VAR CY = [Total Sales]
   VAR PY = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
   RETURN DIVIDE(CY - PY, PY)
   ```  
   *SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR is a must-know for trend analysis.*

5. **Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales**  
   ```DAX
   Sales QTD = TOTALQTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])
   ```  
   *Understand how `TOTALQTD` handles incomplete quarters.*

6. **Month-End Closing Balance**  
   ```DAX
   Closing Balance = 
   CALCULATE(SUM(BalanceSheet[Balance]), 
     LASTNONBLANK('Date'[Date], SUM(BalanceSheet[Balance]))
   ```  
   *Critical for balance sheet reporting (semi-additive measures).*

---

### **Customer & Product Analysis**
7. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**  
   ```DAX
   CLV = 
   AVERAGEX(
     SUMMARIZE(Sales, Customer[ID], "Total", [Total Sales]),
     [Total]
   )
   ```  
   *Shows segmentation and aggregation skills.*

8. **Top 10 Customers by Revenue**  
   ```DAX
   Top 10 Customers = 
   CALCULATE([Total Sales], 
     TOPN(10, ALL(Customer[Name]), [Total Sales], DESC)
   )
   ```  
   *Uses `TOPN` for ranking. Be ready to explain `ALL` vs. `ALLSELECTED`.*

9. **Customer Retention Rate**  
   ```DAX
   Retention Rate = 
   VAR TotalCustomers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID])
   VAR RetainedCustomers = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID]), 
       DATESBETWEEN('Date'[Date], DATE(2023, 1, 1), DATE(2023, 12, 31)))
   RETURN DIVIDE(RetainedCustomers, TotalCustomers)
   ```  
   *Key for CRM/recurring revenue models.*

---

### **Data Validation & QA**
10. **Data Completeness Check**  
    ```DAX
    % Complete Data = 
    DIVIDE(
      COUNTROWS(FILTER(Sales, NOT(ISBLANK(Sales[Amount])))), 
      COUNTROWS(Sales)
    )
    ```  
    *Big 4 interviews often ask about data quality checks.*

11. **Outlier Detection**  
    ```DAX
    Outliers = 
    IF(
      [Total Sales] > 1.5 * [Average Sales], 
      "Flag", 
      "OK"
    )
    ```  
    *Simplified logic for spotting anomalies (adjust thresholds as needed).*

---

### **Dynamic Reporting**
12. **Dynamic Currency Conversion**  
    ```DAX
    Converted Revenue = 
    SUMX(
      Sales, 
      Sales[Revenue] * LOOKUPVALUE(ExchangeRates[Rate], 
        ExchangeRates[Currency], Sales[Currency])
    )
    ```  
    *Big 4 often work with multi-currency global clients.*

13. **Slicer-Driven Measure Selection**  
    ```DAX
    Dynamic Metric = 
    SWITCH(
      SELECTEDVALUE('MetricSelector'[Metric]),
      "Revenue", [Total Sales],
      "Profit", [Gross Profit],
      BLANK()
    )
    ```  
    *Shows UX/design thinking for dashboards.*

---

### **Advanced Filtering**
14. **YTD for Prior Year (Comparative Analysis)**  
    ```DAX
   PY Sales YTD = 
   CALCULATE(
     [Total Sales], 
     SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]),
     DATESYTD('Date'[Date])
   )
   ```  
   *Tests nested context understanding.*

15. **Excluding Weekends/Holidays**  
    ```DAX
   Business Days Sales = 
   CALCULATE([Total Sales], 
     FILTER('Date', 'Date'[IsWeekend] = FALSE && 'Date'[IsHoliday] = FALSE)
   )
   ```  
   *Common in operations/financial reporting.*

---

### **Ranking & Segmentation**
16. **ABC Analysis (Pareto)**  
    ```DAX
   ABC Class = 
   VAR CumulativeSales = 
     SUMX(
       TOPN(100, VALUES(Product[ID]), [Total Sales], DESC),
       [Total Sales]
     )
   RETURN
     SWITCH(
       TRUE(),
       CumulativeSales <= 0.8 * [Total Sales], "A",
       CumulativeSales <= 0.95 * [Total Sales], "B",
       "C"
     )
   ```  
   *80/20 rule for inventory/client prioritization.*

17. **Percentile Rank**  
    ```DAX
   Sales Percentile = 
   PERCENTILEX.INC(
     ALL(Customer[ID]), 
     [Total Sales], 
     0.5
   )
   ```  
   *Useful for benchmarking (e.g., median performance).*

---

### **Optimization & Best Practices**
18. **Measure Totals Row Fix**  
    ```DAX
   Avg Sales per Region = 
   IF(
     ISINSCOPE(Region[Name]), 
     AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]),
     [Total Sales] / DISTINCTCOUNT(Region[Name])
   )
   ```  
   *Handles totals/subtotals in matrices. A common gotcha!*

19. **Avoiding Circular Dependencies**  
    ```DAX
   Safe Ratio = 
   VAR Numerator = [Total Sales]
   VAR Denominator = [Total Budget]
   RETURN
     IF(Denominator = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(Numerator, Denominator))
   ```  
   *Big 4 emphasizes error-proof models.*

---

### **Bonus: Behavioral Tie-In**
20. **Explain a DAX Measure You Built**  
    *Example Answer:*  
    "In a retail project, I created a **dynamic YoY growth measure** using `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` and `CALCULATE` to compare sales across flexible time windows. I added error handling with `DIVIDE` to avoid blank visuals. This helped stakeholders identify seasonal trends."

### **Big 4 Interview Tips**
1. **Focus on Business Context**: Always tie DAX logic to business outcomes (e.g., “This measure tracks client retention for SaaS revenue recognition”).
2. **Keep It Simple**: Use basic functions like `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and `DIVIDE` unless advanced logic is required.
3. **Explain Evaluation Context**: Be ready to sketch a matrix and walk through row vs. filter context.
4. **Test for Edge Cases**: Mention how you’d validate measures (e.g., blanks, zeros, incomplete periods).
5. **Practice STAR Method**: Structure answers as Situation, Task, Action, Result.

These 20 measures cover **80% of Big 4 DAX interview questions**. Pair them with mock case studies (e.g., “How would you calculate client churn?”) to ace your interview! 🎯
