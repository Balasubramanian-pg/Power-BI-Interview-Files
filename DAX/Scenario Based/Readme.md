### **Key Concepts to Master**
- **Evaluation Context**: How `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and iterators modify context.
- **Performance Tuning**: Aggregations, variables, avoiding nested contexts.
- **Advanced Relationships**: Bidirectional filters, M2M, virtual relationships.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing data.
- **Dynamic Patterns**: Parameters, slicers, and user-driven logic.

This list covers **expert-level DAX**â€”think performance tuning, complex model navigation, and real-time analytics. Practice these with real datasets, and youâ€™ll be ready to tackle even the most demanding interview questions! ðŸŽ¯
