## **Core Aggregations & Filters**
1. **Total Sales**  
   ```DAX 
   Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount]) 
   ```  
   *Basic aggregation, but understand context (row vs. filter).*

2. **Average Transaction Value**  
   ```DAX 
   Avg Transaction = AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]) 
   ```  
   *Handles implicit filtering.*

3. **Distinct Count of Customers**  
   ```DAX 
   Unique Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID]) 
   ```  
   *Common for uniqueness checks.*

4. **Filtered Sales (e.g., High-Value)**  
   ```DAX 
   High-Value Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], Sales[Amount] > 1000) 
   ```  
   *Shows `CALCULATE` + conditional logic.*
